  Abstract                 = {The inferior temporal cortex (IT) of primates is thought to be the final visual area in the ventral stream of cortical areas responsible for object recognition. Consistent with this hypothesis, single IT neurons respond selectively to highly complex visual stimuli such as faces. However, a direct causal link between the activity of face-selective neurons and face perception has not been demonstrated. In the present study of macaque monkeys, we artificially activated small clusters of IT neurons by means of electrical microstimulation while the monkeys performed a categorization task, judging whether noisy visual images belonged to 'face' or 'non-face' categories. Here we show that microstimulation of face-selective sites, but not other sites, strongly biased the monkeys' decisions towards the face category. The magnitude of the effect depended upon the degree of face selectivity of the stimulation site, the size of the stimulated cluster of face-selective neurons, and the exact timing of microstimulation. Our results establish a causal relationship between the activity of face-selective neurons and face perception.},

  Abstract                 = {Evoked activity in the mammalian cortex and the resulting behavioral responses exhibit a large variability to repeated presentations of the same stimulus. This study examined whether the variability can be attributed to ongoing activity. Ongoing and evoked spatiotemporal activity patterns in the cat visual cortex were measured with real-time optical imaging; local field potentials and discharges of single neurons were recorded simultaneously, by electrophysiological techniques. The evoked activity appeared deterministic, and the variability resulted from the dynamics of ongoing activity, presumably reflecting the instantaneous state of cortical networks. In spite of the large variability, evoked responses in single trials could be predicted by linear summation of the deterministic response and the preceding ongoing activity. Ongoing activity must play an important role in cortical function and cannot be ignored in exploration of cognitive processes.},

  Abstract                 = {What determines how much an organism can learn? One possibility is that the neural factors that limit sensory performance prior to learning, place an upper limit on the amount of learning that can take place. We tested this idea by comparing learning on a sensory task where performance is limited by cortical mechanisms, at two retinal eccentricities. Prior to learning, visual performance at the two eccentricities was either unmatched or equated in two different ways (through spatial scaling or visual crowding). The magnitude of learning was equivalent when initial levels of performance were matched regardless of how performance was equated. The magnitude of learning was a constant proportion of initial performance. This Weber-like law for perceptual learning demonstrates that it should be possible to predict the degree of perceptual improvement and the final level of performance that can be achieved via sensory training, regardless of what cortical constraint limits performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Anatomic and physiologic data are used to analyze the energy expenditure on different components of excitatory signaling in the grey matter of rodent brain. Action potentials and postsynaptic effects of glutamate are predicted to consume much of the energy (47\% and 34\%, respectively), with the resting potential consuming a smaller amount (13\%), and glutamate recycling using only 3\%. Energy usage depends strongly on action potential rate--an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical neuron/s will raise oxygen consumption by 145 mL/100 g grey matter/h. The energy expended on signaling is a large fraction of the total energy used by the brain; this favors the use of energy efficient neural codes and wiring patterns. Our estimates of energy usage predict the use of distributed codes, with <or=15\% of neurons simultaneously active, to reduce energy consumption and allow greater computing power from a fixed number of neurons. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signals are likely to be dominated by changes in energy usage associated with synaptic currents and action potential propagation.},

During the past decade, with the advent of multi-electrode recording and improved theoretical models, these questions have begun to yield answers. However, a complete understanding of neuronal variability, and, in particular, how it affects population codes, is missing. This is because variability in the brain is typically correlated, and although the exact effects of these correlations are not known, it is known that they can be large. Here, we review studies that address the interaction between neuronal noise and population codes, and discuss their implications for population coding in general.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been proposed that visual information in the extrastriate cortex is conveyed along 2 major processing pathways, a "dorsal" pathway directed to the posterior parietal cortex, underlying spatial vision, and a "ventral" pathway directed to the inferior temporal cortex, underlying object vision. To determine the relative distributions of cells projecting to the 2 pathways, we injected the posterior parietal and inferior temporal cortex with different fluorescent tracers in 5 rhesus monkeys. The parietal injections included the ventral intraparietal (VIP) and lateral intraparietal (LIP) areas, and the temporal injections included the lateral portions of cytoarchitectonic areas TE and TEO. There was a remarkable segregation of cells projecting to the 2 systems. Inputs to the parietal cortex tended to arise either from areas that have been implicated in spatial or motion analysis or from peripheral field representations in the prestriate cortex. By contrast, inputs to the temporal cortex tended to arise from areas that have been implicated in form and color analysis or from central field representations. Cells projecting to the parietal cortex were found in visual area 2 (V2), but only in the far peripheral representations of both the upper and lower visual field. Likewise, labeled cells found in visual areas 3 (V3) and 4 (V4) were densest in their peripheral representations. Heavy accumulations of labeled cells were found in the dorsal parieto-occipital cortex, including the parieto-occipital (PO) area, part A of V3 (V3A), and the dorsal prelunate area (DP). In the superior temporal sulcus, cells were found within several motion-sensitive areas, including the middle temporal area (MT), the medial superior temporal area (MST), the fundus of the superior temporal area (FST), and the superior temporal polysensory area (STP), as well as within anterior portions of the sulcus whose organization is as yet poorly defined. Cells projecting to areas TE and TEO in the temporal cortex were located within cytoarchitectonic area TG at the temporal pole and cytoarchitectonic areas TF and TH on the parahippocampal gyrus, as well as in noninjected portions of area TE buried within the superior temporal sulcus. In the prestriate cortex, labeled cells were found in V2, V3, and V4, but, in contrast to the loci labeled after parietal injections, those labeled after temporal injections were concentrated in the foveal or central field representations. Although few double-labeled cells were seen, 2 regions containing intermingled parietal- and temporal-projection cells were area V4 and the cortex at the bottom of the anterior superior temporal sulcus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Natural scenes contain a rich variety of contours that the visual system extracts to segregate the retinal image into perceptually coherent regions. Covert spatial attention helps extract contours by enhancing contrast sensitivity for 1st-order, luminance-defined patterns at attended locations, while reducing sensitivity at unattended locations, relative to neutral attention allocation. However, humans are also sensitive to 2nd-order patterns such as spatial variations of texture, which are predominant in natural scenes and cannot be detected by linear mechanisms. We assess whether and how exogenous attention--the involuntary and transient capture of spatial attention--affects the contrast sensitivity of channels sensitive to 2nd-order, texture-defined patterns. Using 2nd-order, texture-defined stimuli, we demonstrate that exogenous attention increases 2nd-order contrast sensitivity at the attended location, while decreasing it at unattended locations, relative to a neutral condition. By manipulating both 1st- and 2nd-order spatial frequency, we find that the effects of attention depend both on 2nd-order spatial frequency of the stimulus and the observer's 2nd-order spatial resolution at the target location. At parafoveal locations, attention enhances 2nd-order contrast sensitivity to high, but not to low 2nd-order spatial frequencies; at peripheral locations attention also enhances sensitivity to low 2nd-order spatial frequencies. Control experiments rule out the possibility that these effects might be due to an increase in contrast sensitivity at the 1st-order stage of visual processing. Thus, exogenous attention affects 2nd-order contrast sensitivity at both attended and unattended locations.},

  Abstract                 = {We have recently obtained evidence for complex multifocal, individually variable generators of slow cortical potentials, elicited during performance of visual tasks involving expecting attention, comparison and memory [Basile, L.F.H., Ballester, G., Castro, C.C., and Gattaz, W.F., 2002. Multifocal slow potential generators revealed by high-resolution EEG and current density reconstruction. Int. J.

Psychophysiol., 48, 55-65]. The cue-target aspect of traditional paradigms for attention studies is equivalent to 'warning S1'-'imperative S2' in slow potential designs. We simplified Posner's spatial cueing task [Posner, M.I. 1980. Orienting of attention.Q. J. Exp. Psychol. Feb;32 (1), 3-25; Posner, M.I., Snyder, C.R., Davidson, B.J. 1980. Attention and the detection of signals. J Exp Psychol. Jun; 109 (2), 160-174] to temporal cuing only, by using visual cues to indicate the mere presence, on a known central position, of the eventual target (17 ms duration, +/-0.3 degrees grey circle). We recorded slow potentials on 12 healthy subjects, by 124-channel EEG system (Neuroscan Inc.), and modeled their generators using current density reconstruction (CDR) by L(p) 1.2 norm minimization ("Curry V4.6", Neurosoft Inc.) applied to the target onset time. MRIs were obtained for each subject for constraining source models to individual brain anatomy. Average slow potentials were computed from above 60 artifact-free EEG-epochs (ISI=1.6 s, average ITI=2.5 s). We tabulated individual cortical current distributions by cytoarchitectonic area of Brodmann, after scaling into negligible, low, moderate and strong local density, based on percentile bands with respect to absolute maximum current. Despite the task's simplicity, the main result was individual variability and complexity in both scalp voltage and cortical current distributions. As observed in our previous studies, there was strong intersubject variability in the exact distribution of task-related cortical activity. Only parietal area 7 bilaterally was non-negligibly active in all subjects (currents above 10\% maximum). As opposed to drawing conclusions based on group averaged data, we propose that activity by cytoarchitectonic area be ranked and statistically analysed only after being scaled on each individual. Based on the present results, the concept of a universal attention-related set of cortical areas if restricted to common areas across subjects is challenged, since even area 7 may no longer be common when the sample size becomes larger. We discuss the fact that group averaging may de-emphasize weakly but consistently active areas, and emphasize strongly but inconsistently active ones.},

We tested the rule of good continuation by stimulating behaving monkeys with simple figures composed of Gabor patches, while recording from upper layer cells in visual cortex (V1). By decomposing these figures into their components and stimulating receptive field centers and surrounds separately with this stimulus set, we tested center-surround interaction for linearity. In pure-fixation tasks, the interaction was negative for the early strong evoked response, i.e., in this phase figural context rather inhibited the cells. However, in the following tonic response phase, a subgroup of neurons showed positive interaction during the whole stimulus presentation period of at least 1,000 ms. Attention to the figure in discrimination tasks only slightly improved this positive interaction between 150 and 300 ms. We interpret these results as selective cooperation and mutual facilitation of cortical V1 cells, thereby supporting the saliency of borders and contours in perception of visual scenes.},

If the stimuli are presented very briefly, eye movements are not possible. The time during which the after-image of the stimulus is available for inspection is terminated by presentation of a masking pattern. We show here that in these conditions a small pattern is easily detected against a background made up of many others, only if this target pattern differs from the background patterns in certain local features. In this case the detectability of the target is almost independent of the number of background elements, suggesting that a parallel process is operating. Detection of patterns not differing from their backgrounds in such features requires focal attention which is a serial process. The aperture of this attention is scaled to minimize the number of shifts of attention required.},

Although behavioral studies have demonstrated that these internal models are optimally adapted to the statistics of the environment, the neural underpinning of this adaptation is unknown. Using a Bayesian model of sensory cortical processing, we related stimulus-evoked and spontaneous neural activities to inferences and prior expectations in an internal model and predicted that they should match if the model is statistically optimal. To test this prediction, we analyzed visual cortical activity of awake ferrets during development. Similarity between spontaneous and evoked activities increased with age and was specific to responses evoked by natural scenes. This demonstrates the progressive adaptation of internal models to the statistics of natural stimuli at the neural level.},

  Abstract                 = {In cluttered scenes, we can use feature-based attention to quickly locate a target object. To understand how feature attention is used to find and select objects for action, we focused on the ventral prearcuate (VPA) region of prefrontal cortex. In a visual search task, VPA cells responded selectively to search cues, maintained their feature selectivity throughout the delay and subsequent saccades, and discriminated the search target in their receptive fields with a time course earlier than in FEF or IT cortex. Inactivation of VPA impaired the animals' ability to find targets, and simultaneous recordings in FEF revealed that the effects of feature attention were eliminated while leaving the effects of spatial attention in FEF intact. Altogether, the results suggest that VPA neurons compute the locations of objects with the features sought and send this information to FEF to guide eye movements to those relevant stimuli.},

  Abstract                 = {We developed a quantitative description of the circuits formed in cat area 17 by estimating the "weight" of the projections between different neuronal types. To achieve this, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 39 single neurons and thalamic afferents labeled with horseradish peroxidase during intracellular recordings in vivo. These neurons served as representatives of the different types and provided the morphometrical data about the laminar distribution of the dendritic trees and synaptic boutons and the number of synapses formed by a given type of neuron. Extensive searches of the literature provided the estimates of numbers of the different neuronal types and their distribution across the cortical layers. Applying the simplification that synapses between different cell types are made in proportion to the boutons and dendrites that those cell types contribute to the neuropil in a given layer, we were able to estimate the probable source and number of synapses made between neurons in the six layers. The predicted synaptic maps were quantitatively close to the estimates derived from the experimental electron microscopic studies for the case of the main sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to the spiny stellate cells, which form a major target of layer 4 afferents. The map of the whole cortical circuit shows that there are very few "strong" but many "weak" excitatory projections, each of which may involve only a few percentage of the total complement of excitatory synapses of a single neuron.},

  Abstract                 = {1. A task was used by Posner (1980) to measure shifts of attention that occurred covertly, in the absence of an eye movement or other orienting response. This paradigm was used here to assess the nature of covert attentional orienting in monkeys to develop an animal model for neurophysiological studies. Shifts of attention were measurable in monkeys and were consistent across a variety of experimental conditions. 2. The paradigm required that monkeys fixate and release a bar at the appearance of a target, which was preceded by a cue. Reaction times to targets that followed peripheral cues at the same location (validly cued) were significantly faster than those that followed cues in the opposite visual field (invalidly cued). This difference was defined as the validity effect, which as in humans, is used as the measure of a covert attentional shift. 3. When the proportion of validly to invalidly cued targets was decreased, no change was seen in the validity effect of the monkeys. This is in contrast to humans, for whom the ratio of validly to invalidly cued targets affected the magnitude of the validity effect. When 80\% of the targets were preceded by cues at the same location, the validity effect was greatest. The effect was reversed when the proportions were reversed. From this result, it is concluded that cognitive processes can affect covert orienting to peripheral cues in humans, whereas in trained monkeys, performance was automatic. 4. To test whether cognitive influences on attention could be demonstrated in the monkey, an animal was taught to use symbolic, foveal signals to covertly direct attention. The magnitude of this validity effect was greater than that obtained with peripheral cues. 5. The effects of motivational and perceptual processes were tested. Although overall reaction times could be modified, the facilitating effects of the cues persisted. This constancy across motivational and perceptual levels supports the notion that the monkeys were performing the task in an automatic way, under the exogenous control of peripheral cues. 6. Most visual cuing has been tested with visual landmarks at the locations of cues and targets. These monkeys were trained with such landmarks, and when tested without them, the attentional effect of the cues was nearly abolished. These data suggest that local visual features can be important for covert orienting. 7. To determine the spatial extent of the effect of the cue, monkeys and humans were tested with four cue-target distances (0-60 degrees).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The size and orientation of the stimuli were held constant regardless of receptive field parameters. In both tasks, the single-cell activity immediately following the presentation of flashed discrimination stimuli reflected only stimulus parameters, and was independent of the monkey's behavioral choice. Later activity (up to 400 msec post-stimulus) was significantly greater if the monkey was about to press the correct panel in the discrimination, or if he pressed the unmasked side (with greater apparent brightness but identical intensity) in the masking paradigm. One quarter of the cells showed a change in firing rate during the 250 msec preceding the behavioral response, though the difference in overall firing level between correct and incorrect brightness discrimination trials was diminished in this epoch, and the corresponding firing difference in metacontrast trials was not significant. The temporal pattern of firing also differed between correct and incorrect trials in the pre-response interval. The results suggest an iterative or recurrent coding of visual information, where the same cells participate in early, late, preresponse coding in different ways.},

  Abstract                 = {Past studies of shape coding in visual cortical area V4 have demonstrated that neurons can accurately represent isolated shapes in terms of their component contour features. However, rich natural scenes contain many partially occluded objects, which have "accidental" contours at the junction between the occluded and occluding objects. These contours do not represent the true shape of the occluded object and are known to be perceptually discounted. To discover whether V4 neurons differentially encode accidental contours, we studied the responses of single neurons in fixating monkeys to complex shapes and contextual stimuli presented either in isolation or adjoining each other to provide a percept of partial occlusion. Responses to preferred contours were suppressed when the adjoining context rendered those contours accidental. The observed suppression was reversed when the partial occlusion percept was compromised by introducing a small gap between the component stimuli. Control experiments demonstrated that these results likely depend on contour geometry at T-junctions and cannot be attributed to mechanisms based solely on local color/luminance contrast, spatial proximity of stimuli, or the spatial frequency content of images. Our findings provide novel insights into how occluded objects, which are fundamental to complex visual scenes, are encoded in area V4. They also raise the possibility that the weakened encoding of accidental contours at the junction between objects could mark the first step of image segmentation along the ventral visual pathway.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamically shifting attention between behaviorally relevant stimuli in the environment is a key condition for successful adaptive behavior. Here, we investigated how exogenous (reflexive) and endogenous (voluntary) shifts of visual spatial attention interact to modulate activity of single neurons in extrastriate area MT. We used a double-cueing paradigm, in which the first cue instructed two macaque monkeys to covertly attend to one of three moving random dot patterns until a second cue, whose unpredictable onset exogenously captured attention, either signaled to shift or maintain the current focus of attention. The neuronal activity revealed correlates of both exogenous and endogenous attention, which could be well distinguished by their characteristic temporal dynamics. The earliest effect was a transient interruption of the focus of endogenous attention by the onset of the second cue. The neuronal signature of this exogenous capture of attention was a short-latency decrease of responses to the stimulus attended so far. About 70 ms later, the influence of exogenous attention leveled off, which was reflected in two concurrent processes: responses to the newly cued stimulus continuously increased because of allocation of endogenous attention, while, surprisingly, there was also a gradual rebound of attentional enhancement of the previously relevant stimulus. Only after an additional 110 ms did endogenous disengagement of attention from this previously relevant stimulus become evident. These patterns of attentional modulation can be most parsimoniously explained by assuming two distinct attentional mechanisms drawing on the same capacity-limited system, with exogenous attention having a much faster time course than endogenous attention.},

  Abstract                 = {Neural oscillations have been measured and interpreted in multitudinous ways, with a variety of hypothesized functions in physiology, information processing and cognition. Much attention has been paid in recent years to gamma-band (30-100 Hz) oscillations and synchrony, with an increasing interest in 'high gamma' (>100 Hz) signals as mesoscopic measures of inter-regional communication. The biophysical origins of the measured variables are often difficult to precisely identify, however, making their interpretation fraught with pitfalls. Here we discuss how measurements of inter-regional gamma coherence can be prone to misinterpretation and suggest strategies for deciphering the roles that synchronized oscillations across brain networks may play in neural function.},

This circuitry is described here in the context of a two-level model that distinguishes between feedforward and feedback connections. Embedded within this basic framework is a more complex organization. Within the strictly feedforward pathway, these circuits distribute unique combinations of magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to neurons in layers 2-4B. Their input is dependent on the extrastriate cortical areas they target. The local feedback connections from deep layers (5 and 6) arise from a diverse population of pyramidal neurons. Each type forms local connections with a unique relationship to more superficial layers. In the case of layer 6 neurons, these connections are closely related to layer 4 subdivisions receiving input from different functional streams.},

Transient covert attention decreased both the threshold (consistent with a contrast gain mechanism) and, less consistently, the slope of the psychometric function. We assessed performance at 8 equidistant locations (4.5 degrees eccentricity) and found that threshold and slope depended on target location-both were higher on the vertical than the horizontal meridian, particularly directly above fixation. All effects were robust across a range of spatial frequencies, and the visual field asymmetries increased with spatial frequency. Notwithstanding the dependence of the psychometric function on target location, attention improved performance to a similar extent across the visual field.Given that, in this study, we excluded all sources of external noise, and that we showed experimentally that spatial uncertainty cannot explain the present results, we conclude that the observed attentional benefit is consistent with signal enhancement.},

  Abstract                 = {There is increasing evidence that the brain relies on a set of canonical neural computations, repeating them across brain regions and modalities to apply similar operations to different problems. A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},

In addition, each simple cell's linear response is divided by the pooled activity of a large number of other simple cells. The cell membrane performs both operations; synaptic currents are summed and then divided by the total membrane conductance. Current and conductance are decoupled (by a complementary arrangement of excitation and inhibition) so that current depends only on the LGN inputs and conductance depends only on the cortical inputs. Closed form expressions were derived for fitting and interpreting physiological data.

(b) As the area of the attentional focus increases, is there a decrease in processing efficiency for stimuli within the focus? (c) Is the boundary of the focus sharply demarked from the residual field or does it show a gradual dropoff? The results seem to provide answers to these questions: (a) the size of the attentional focus can be adjusted so that it covers areas of the visual field of different size; (b) there is a decrease in processing efficiency when the area of the attentional focus increases; and (c) there is a gradual dropoff in processing efficiency around the attentional focus.},

  Abstract                 = {In natural images, visual objects are typically occluded by other objects. A remarkable ability of our visual system is to complete occluded objects effortlessly and see whole, uninterrupted objects. How object completion is implemented in the visual system is still largely unknown. In this study, using a backward masking paradigm, we combined psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the temporal evolvement of face completion at different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. Human subjects were presented with two kinds of stimuli that were designed to elicit or not elicit the percept of a completed face, although they were physically very similar. By contrasting subjects' behavioral and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to completed and noncompleted faces, we measured the psychophysical time course of the face completion and its underlying cortical dynamics. We found that face completion manifested its effect between 50 and 250 ms after stimulus onset. Relative to noncompleted faces, completed faces induced weaker BOLD response at early processing phases in retinotopic visual areas V1 and V2 and stronger BOLD response at late processing phases in occipital face area and fusiform face area. Attending away from the stimuli largely abolished these effects. These findings suggest that face completion consists of two synergetic phases: early suppression in lower visual areas and late enhancement in higher visual areas; moreover, attention is necessary to these neural events.},

  Abstract                 = {The traditional view on visual processing emphasizes a hierarchy: local line segments are first linked into global contours, which in turn are assembled into more complex forms. Distinct from this bottom-up viewpoint, here we provide evidence for a theoretical framework whereby objects and their parts are processed almost concurrently in a bidirectional cortico-cortical loop. By simultaneous recordings from V1 and V4 in awake monkeys, we found that information about global contours in a cluttered background emerged initially in V4, started �0�9�0�8�0�440 ms later in V1, and continued to develop in parallel in both areas. Detailed analysis of neuronal response properties implicated contour integration to emerge from both bottom-up and reentrant processes. Our results point to an incremental integration mechanism: feedforward assembling accompanied by feedback disambiguating to define and enhance the global contours and to suppress background noise. The consequence is a parallel accumulation of contour information over multiple cortical areas.},

In this paper, the authors provided tha evidence that the contour integration may happen in an incremental way with a close interaction between V1 and V4. The colinearaty is very important for the contour modulation. The contour modulation in V4 is orientation depandent. However, although the contour response in V1 is highly orintation dependent, the d-prime is not. Suggesting the global contour signal in individual V1 cells is not local feature dependent.},

  Abstract                 = {An essential step in understanding visual processing is to characterize the neuronal receptive fields (RFs) at each stage of the visual pathway. However, RF characterization beyond simple cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) remains a major challenge. Recent application of spike-triggered covariance (STC) analysis has greatly facilitated characterization of complex cell RFs in anesthetized animals. Here we apply STC to RF characterization in awake monkey V1. We found up to nine subunits for each cell, including one or two dominant excitatory subunits as described by the standard model, along with additional excitatory and suppressive subunits with weaker contributions. Compared with the dominant subunits, the nondominant excitatory subunits prefer similar orientations and spatial frequencies but have larger spatial envelopes. They contribute to response invariance to small changes in stimulus orientation, position, and spatial frequency. In contrast, the suppressive subunits are tuned to orientations 45 degrees -90 degrees different from the excitatory subunits, which may underlie cross-orientation suppression. Together, the excitatory and suppressive subunits form a compact description of RFs in awake monkey V1, allowing prediction of the responses to arbitrary visual stimuli.},

Despite evidence for internally generated representations at early stages of cortical processing, it is not known whether these representations include missing information of dynamically transforming objects. Long-range apparent motion (AM) provides a unique test case because objects in AM can undergo changes both in position and in features. Using fMRI and encoding methods, we found that the "intermediate" orientation of an apparently rotating grating, never presented in the retinal input but interpolated during AM, is reconstructed in population-level, feature-selective tuning responses in the region of early visual cortex (V1) that corresponds to the retinotopic location of the AM path. This neural representation is absent when AM inducers are presented simultaneously and when AM is visually imagined. Our results demonstrate dynamic filling-in in V1 for object features that are interpolated during kinetic transformations.},

Attention also typically increases the firing rates of cortical sensory neurons. Rate increases improve the signal-to-noise ratio of individual neurons, and this improvement has been assumed to underlie attention-related improvements in behavior. We recorded dozens of neurons simultaneously in visual area V4 and found that changes in single neurons accounted for only a small fraction of the improvement in the sensitivity of the population. Instead, over 80\% of the attentional improvement in the population signal was caused by decreases in the correlations between the trial-to-trial fluctuations in the responses of pairs of neurons. These results suggest that the representation of sensory information in populations of neurons and the way attention affects the sensitivity of the population may only be understood by considering the interactions between neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {Mirror neurons (MNs) in the inferior parietal lobule and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) can code the intentions of other individuals using contextual cues. Gaze direction is an important social cue that can be used for understanding the meaning of actions made by other individuals. Here we addressed the issue of whether PMv MNs are influenced by the gaze direction of another individual. We recorded single-unit activity in macaque PMv while the monkey was observing an experimenter performing a grasping action and orienting his gaze either toward (congruent gaze condition) or away (incongruent gaze condition) from a target object. The results showed that one-half of the recorded MNs were modulated by the gaze direction of the human agent. These gaze-modulated neurons were evenly distributed between those preferring a gaze direction congruent with the direction where the grasping action was performed and the others that preferred an incongruent gaze. Whereas the presence of congruent responses is in line with the usual coupling of hand and gaze in both executed and observed actions, the incongruent responses can be explained by the long exposure of the monkeys to this condition. Our results reveal that the representation of observed actions in PMv is influenced by contextual information not only extracted from physical cues, but also from cues endowed with biological or social value.In this study, we present the first evidence showing that social cues modulate MNs in the monkey ventral premotor cortex. These data suggest that there is an integrated representation of other's hand actions and gaze direction at the single neuron level in the ventral premotor cortex, and support the hypothesis of a functional role of MNs in decoding actions and understanding motor intentions.},

The existence of such plasticity, and the characteristics of a form of implicit learning known as perceptual learning, suggest that changes in primary sensory cortex may mediate learning. We explored whether modification of the functional properties of primary visual cortex (V1) accompanies perceptual learning. Basic receptive field properties, such as location, size and orientation selectivity, were unaffected by perceptual training, and visual topography (as measured by magnification factor) was indistinguishable between trained and untrained animals. On the other hand, the influence of contextual stimuli placed outside the receptive field showed a change consistent with the trained discrimination. Furthermore, this property showed task dependence, only being manifest when the animal was performing the trained discrimination.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines the role of spatial frequency and orientation tuned channels in the perception of visual symmetry. Subjects discriminated between band-pass filtered, white noise textures that either did or did not contain vertical bilateral symmetry (VBS, i.e., around a vertical midline) as a function of the spatial phase disruption imposed on the images. Resistance to phase noise is largely scale-invariant for isotropically filtered images, but horizontally filtered images are consistently more noise-resistant than vertical. However, when stimuli are rotated through 90 deg (horizontal bilateral symmetry, HBS) performance is better with vertically filtered images suggesting a general advantage for orientations orthogonal to the axis of symmetry. At these orientations symmetry may be signaled directly by clusters of features along the axis. Our data further suggest that the established disadvantage for HBS may be attributable to an over-reliance on the output of horizontal filters. We compare models which exploit feature clustering around the axis by measuring the co-alignment in the output of oriented filters. Models using filters oriented orthogonal to the axis of symmetry predict the psychophysical performance for isotropic patterns and for patterns filtered orthogonal to the axis. For patterns filtered parallel to the axis, our data suggest that visual attention may play a role.},

This effect can be explained in terms of a Bayesian observer where visual attention simply weights the information differently at the cued (attended) and uncued (unattended) locations without a change in the quality of processing at each location. Alternatively, it could also be explained in terms of visual attention changing the shape of the perceptual filter at the cued location. In this study, we use the classification image technique to compare the human perceptual filters at the cued and uncued locations in a contrast discrimination task. We did not find statistically significant differences between the shapes of the inferred perceptual filters across the two locations, nor did the observed differences account for the measured cueing effects in human observers. Instead, we found a difference in the magnitude of the classification images, supporting the idea that visual attention changes the weighting of information at the cued and uncued location, but does not change the quality of processing at each individual location.},

  Abstract                 = {The abundant concentration of cytochrome oxidase in patches or blobs of primate striate cortex has never been explained. Patches are thought to contain unoriented, color-opponent neurons. Lacking orientation selectivity, these cells might endow patches with high metabolic activity because they respond to all contours in visual scenes. To test this idea, we measured orientation tuning in layer 2/3 of macaque cortical area V1 using acutely implanted 100-electrode arrays. Each electrode recording site was identified and assigned to the patch or interpatch compartment. The mean orientation bandwidth of cells was 28.4�0�0�� in patches and 25.8�0�0�� in interpatches. Neurons in patches were indeed less orientation selective, but the difference was subtle, indicating that the processing of form and color is not strictly segregated in V1. The most conspicuous finding was that patch cells had a 49\% greater overall firing rate. This global difference in neuronal responsiveness, rather than an absence of orientation tuning, may account for the rich mitochondrial enzyme activity that defines patches.},

B virus (Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1; BV) is an alpha-herpesvirus that naturally infects conventional populations of macaques. Serious disease due to BV is rare in macaques, but when transmitted to humans, BV has a propensity to invade the central nervous system and has a fatality rate greater than 70\% if not treated promptly. The severe consequences of human BV infections led to the inclusion of BV in the original NIH list of target viruses for elimination by development of specific pathogen-free rhesus colonies. In macaques and especially in humans, diagnosis of BV infection is not straightforward. Furthermore, development and maintenance of true BV specific pathogen-free macaque colonies has proven dif cult. In this overview we review the natural history of BV in macaques, summarize what is known about the virus at the molecular level, and relate this information to problems associated with diagnosis of BV infections and development of BV-free macaque colonies.},

The visual system can integrate such object fragments across space and time into perceptual wholes or spatiotemporal objects. This integrative and dynamic process may involve both ventral and dorsal visual processing pathways, along which shape and spatial representations are thought to arise. We measured fMRI BOLD response to spatiotemporal objects and used multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode shape information across 20 topographic regions of visual cortex. Object identity could be decoded throughout visual cortex, including intermediate (V3A, V3B, hV4, LO1-2,) and dorsal (TO1-2, and IPS0-1) visual areas. Shape-specific information, therefore, may not be limited to early and ventral visual areas, particularly when it is dynamic and must be integrated. Contrary to the classic view that the representation of objects is the purview of the ventral stream, intermediate and dorsal areas may play a distinct and critical role in the construction of object representations across space and time.},

  Abstract                 = {How do stimuli in the environment interact with the goals of observers? We addressed this question by showing that the relevance of an abruptly appearing visual object (cue) changes how observers orient attention toward a subsequent object (target) and how this target is represented in the activity of neurons in the superior colliculus. Initially after the appearance of the cue, attention is driven to its locus. This capture of attention is followed by a second bias in orienting attention, where observers preferentially orient to new locations in the visual scene-an effect called inhibition of return. In the superior colliculus, these two automatic biases in orienting attention were associated with changes in neural activity linked to the appearance of the target-relatively stronger activity linked to the capture of attention and weaker activity linked to inhibition of return. This behavioral pattern changes when the cue predicts the upcoming location of the target-the benefit associated with the capture of attention is enhanced and inhibition of return is reduced. These goal-driven changes in behavior were associated with an increase in pretarget- and target-related activity. Taken together, the goals of observers modify stimulus-driven changes in neural activity with both signals represented in the salience maps of the superior colliculi.},

  Abstract                 = {How do visual signals evolve from early to late stages in sensory processing? We explored this question by examining two neural correlates of spatial attention. The capture of attention and inhibition of return refer to the initial advantage and subsequent disadvantage to respond to a visual target that follows an irrelevant visual cue at the same location. In the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (a region that receives input from late stages in visual processing), both behavioral effects link to changes in the neural representation of the target: strong target-related activity correlates with the capture of attention and weak target-related activity correlates with inhibition of return. Contrasting these correlates with those obtained in the superficial layers (a functionally distinct region that receives input from early stages in visual processing), we show that the target-related activity of neurons in the intermediate layers was the best predictor of orienting behavior, although dramatic changes in the target-related response were observed in both subregions. We describe the important consequences of these findings for understanding the neural basis of the capture of attention and inhibition of return and interpreting changes in neural activity more generally.},

Recent neurophysiological results suggest that the central processing of evidence leading to a perceptual decision also establishes a level of confidence. Here we provide a causal test of this hypothesis by electrically stimulating areas of the visual cortex involved in motion perception. Monkeys discriminated the direction of motion in a noisy display and were sometimes allowed to opt out of the direction choice if their confidence was low. Microstimulation did not reduce overall confidence in the decision but instead altered confidence in a manner that mimicked a change in visual motion, plus a small increase in sensory noise. The results suggest that the same sensory neural signals support choice, reaction time, and confidence in a decision and that artificial manipulation of these signals preserves the quantitative relationship between accumulated evidence and confidence.},

  Abstract                 = {Exposure to repeated, intermittent, escalating doses of amphetamine in rats disrupts information processing in several tasks. Some of these deficits, notably impaired attentional set shifting, may reflect altered prefrontal cortex function. This study examined the effects of repeated treatment with amphetamine on performance in the 5-choice serial reaction time test. This test measures sustained visual attention, a behavior that is known to require the prefrontal cortex. Rats were trained to respond to a brief light stimulus presented randomly in one of five spatial locations, with 100 trials per session. Once performance had stabilized rats were treated with escalating doses of amphetamine (three injections per week for 5 weeks at 1-5 mg/kg per week); testing was continued on nondrug days, and for several weeks of withdrawal. During the amphetamine-treatment and withdrawal phases accuracy of responding was unaffected, but errors of omission increased. Lengthening the stimulus duration abolished this effect. Reducing the stimulus duration also reduced response accuracy and this effect was more marked in amphetamine-treated rats. Both reduced accuracy, and increased omissions, seen in amphetamine-treated rats were reversed by injecting the D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 into the medial prefrontal cortex. This treatment also prevented the decline in accuracy in control animals that resulted from reducing the stimulus duration. These results, indicating that exposure to amphetamine induces a long-lasting deficit in visual attention, add to a growing list of deficits suggesting that amphetamine-sensitized state may model the cognitive deficit state in schizophrenia. The reversal of these deficits by a D1 receptor agonist provides further evidence that prefrontal D1 dopamine receptors are involved in cognition, and may be a potential target for treatment of impaired cognition in schizophrenia.},

In Experiment 2, invalid color precues produced greater costs for color targets than for abrupt-onset targets. Experiment 3 provided converging evidence for this pattern. Experiment 4 investigated the boundary conditions and time course for attention shifts elicited by color discontinuities.

  Abstract                 = {The spatial and temporal frequency selectivity of 148 neurones in the striate cortex, V1, and of 122 neurones in the second visual cortical area, V2, of the macaque monkey were studied using sine-wave gratings of suprathreshold contrast drifting over the receptive field at the preferred orientation and direction. Neurones in V1 and V2 were selective for different but partially overlapping ranges of the spatial frequency spectrum. At retinal eccentricities of 2-5 deg from the fovea, the spatial frequency preferences for neurones ranged from 0.5 to 8.0 cycles/deg in V1 and from 0.2 to 2.1 cycles/deg in V2 and were on average almost 2 octaves lower in V2 than in V1. Spatial frequency full band widths in the two cortical areas were in the range 0.8-3.0 octaves, with a mean value of 1.8 octaves, in the parafoveal representation of both V1 and V2, and 1.4 and 1.6 octaves respectively in the foveal representation of V1 and V2. Most neurones in V1 and some in V2 responded well at temporal frequencies up to 5.6-8.0 Hz before their responses dropped off at still higher frequencies. In V1, 68\% of the neurones exhibited low-pass temporal tuning characteristics and 32\% were very broadly tuned, with a mean temporal frequency full band width of 2.9 octaves. However, in V2 only 30\% of the neurones showed low-pass temporal selectivity and 70\% of the cells had bandpass temporal characteristics, with a mean full band width of 2.1 octaves. In V2 the minimal overlap of bandpass tuning curves across the temporal frequency spectrum suggests that there are at least two distinct bandpass temporal frequency mechanisms as well as neurones with low-pass temporal frequency tuning at each spatial frequency. A matrix of spatial and temporal frequency combinations was employed as stimuli for neurones with bandpass temporal frequency selectivity in both V1 and V2. The resultant spatio-temporal surfaces provided evidence that a neurone's preference for spatial frequency is essentially independent of the test temporal frequency; however, in V2 there was some tendency for temporal frequency peaks to shift slightly towards lower frequencies when non-optimum values of spatial frequency either above or below the preferred value were tested. Neurones with pronounced directional selectivity were encountered over a wide range of spatial frequencies, although in both cortical areas there was a tendency for an increased incidence of directional selectivity among neurones which were selective for lower spatial frequencies and higher temporal frequencies.},

  Abstract                 = {Collinear patterns of local visual stimuli are used to study contextual effects in the visual system. Previous studies have shown that proximal collinear flankers, unlike orthogonal, can enhance the detection of a low contrast central element. However, the direct neural interactions between cortical populations processing the individual flanker elements and the central element are largely unknown.Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) we imaged neural population responses in V1 and V2 areas in fixating monkeys while they were presented with collinear or orthogonal arrays of Gabor patches. We then studied the spatio-temporal interactions between neuronal populations processing individual Gabor patches in the two conditions. Time-frequency analysis of the stimulus-evoked VSDI signal showed power increase mainly in low frequencies, i.e., the alpha band (��; 7-14 Hz). Power in the ��-band was more discriminative at a single trial level than other neuronal population measures. Importantly, the collinear condition showed an increased intra-areal (V1-V1 and V2-V2) and inter-areal (V1-V2) ��-coherence with shorter latencies than the orthogonal condition, both before and after the removal of the stimulus contribution. ��-coherence appeared between discrete neural populations processing the individual Gabor patches: the central element and the flankers.Our findings suggest that collinear effects are mediated by synchronization in a distributed network of proximal and distant neuronal populations within and across V1 and V2.},

  Abstract                 = {The visual cortex has the capacity for experience-dependent change, or cortical plasticity, that is retained throughout life. Plasticity is invoked for encoding information during perceptual learning, by internally representing the regularities of the visual environment, which is useful for facilitating intermediate-level vision--contour integration and surface segmentation. The same mechanisms have adaptive value for functional recovery after CNS damage, such as that associated with stroke or neurodegenerative disease. A common feature to plasticity in primary visual cortex (V1) is an association field that links contour elements across the visual field. The circuitry underlying the association field includes a plexus of long-range horizontal connections formed by cortical pyramidal cells. These connections undergo rapid and exuberant sprouting and pruning in response to removal of sensory input, which can account for the topographic reorganization following retinal lesions. Similar alterations in cortical circuitry may be involved in perceptual learning, and the changes observed in V1 may be representative of how learned information is encoded throughout the cerebral cortex.},

These changes constitute the mechanism of perceptual learning in normal visual experience and in recovery of function after CNS damage. Such plasticity can be seen at multiple stages in the visual pathway, including primary visual cortex. The manifestation of the functional changes associated with perceptual learning involve both long term modification of cortical circuits during the course of learning, and short term dynamics in the functional properties of cortical neurons. These dynamics are subject to top-down influences of attention, expectation and perceptual task. As a consequence, each cortical area is an adaptive processor, altering its function in accordance to immediate perceptual demands.},

Symmetry perception has been demonstrated in humans, birds, dolphins and apes. Here we show that bees trained to discriminate bilaterally symmetrical from non-symmetrical patterns learn the task and transfer it appropriately to novel stimuli, thus demonstrating a capacity to detect and generalize symmetry or asymmetry. We conclude that bees, and possibly flower-visiting insects in general, can acquire a generalized preference towards symmetrical or, alternatively, asymmetrical patterns depending on experience, and that symmetry detection is preformed or can be learned as perceptual category by insects, because it can be extracted as an independent visual pattern feature. Bees show a predisposition for learning and generalized symmetry because, if trained to it, they choose it more frequently, come closer to and hover longer in front of the novel symmetrical stimuli than the bees trained for asymmetry do for the novel asymmetrical stimuli. Thus, even organisms with comparatively small nervous systems can generalize about symmetry, and favour symmetrical over asymmetrical patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {This study investigated the influence of spatial cueing (valid/invalid/no cue) on visual discrimination in human and non-human primates. We employed a spatial resolution task which required the accurate discrimination of the orientation of a Landolt "C" ring. The C appeared as single target in specific retinal locations while subjects maintained fixation of a central fixation point. The minimal discernable size of the "C" (=acuity threshold) was determined as a function of cue condition, retinal eccentricity (3 degrees -15 degrees ), and stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) (200-1100 ms). For both species, we found consistent benefits from spatial cueing with differences in absolute thresholds ranging from 6\% to 25\%. These differences increased with retinal eccentricity and decreased with longer SOAs. Further experiments performed with humans only, showed that the effect of spatial cueing on visual discrimination is independent of spatial uncertainty, i.e. the number of possible target locations (2 versus 4), but fades with longer target presentation times. From our results we draw the following conclusions. (i) Since sensory noise and spatial uncertainty was small in our tasks, spatial shifts of attention involve signal enhancement in both, human and non-human primates. (ii) The similarity of the results obtained for humans and macaque monkeys indicates that the latter may serve as a suitable model system in studies trying to tackle the neural underpinnings of attentional control. (iii) In order to elicit robust effects on visual discrimination by spatial shifts of attention, a paradigm comprising short SOAs (approximately 200 ms) and target presentation times (approximately 150 ms), and retinal eccentricities larger than approximately 9 degrees seems most promising.},

The model explains the diversity of orientation selectivity with neuron-to-neuron variability in all three mechanisms, of which variability in the orientation bandwidth of linear filtering is the most important. The model also accounts for the cells' diversity of spatial frequency selectivity. Tuning diversity is matched to the needs of visual encoding. The orientation content found in natural scenes is diverse, and neurons with different selectivities are adapted to different stimulus configurations. Single orientations are better encoded by highly selective neurons, while orientation mixtures are better encoded by less selective neurons. A diverse population of neurons therefore provides better overall discrimination capabilities for natural images than any homogeneous population.},

We have tested the responses of LIP neurons to stimuli that entered their receptive field by saccades. Neurons had little or no response to stimuli brought into their receptive field by saccades, unless the stimuli were behaviourally significant. We established behavioural significance in two ways: either by making a stable stimulus task-relevant, or by taking advantage of the attentional attraction of an abruptly appearing stimulus. Our results show that under ordinary circumstances the entire visual world is only weakly represented in LIP. The visual representation in LIP is sparse, with only the most salient or behaviourally relevant objects being strongly represented.},

The neuronal firing pattern is tightly correlated with the phase and amplitude of an oscillatory local field potential recorded through the same electrode. The amplitude of the local field-potential oscillations are maximal in response to stimuli that match the orientation and direction preference of the local cluster of neurons. Single and multiunit recordings from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus showed no evidence of oscillations of the neuronal firing probability in the range of 20-70 Hz. The results demonstrate that local neuronal populations in the visual cortex engage in stimulus-specific synchronous oscillations resulting from an intracortical mechanism. The oscillatory responses may provide a general mechanism by which activity patterns in spatially separate regions of the cortex are temporally coordinated.},

  Abstract                 = {In peripheral vision, objects that are visible in isolation become difficult to identify in clutter. This crowding effect is typically strong when objects are similar in a given dimension (e.g., color) and weak when they differ. Here we examine the selectivity of crowding for temporal differences-namely, the transient signals associated with object onsets and offsets. Observers judged the orientation of a peripheral Gabor target surrounded by four flankers. Midway through each trial, selected elements "blinked" off and on again. Performance was poor (crowding was strong) when all Gabors blinked simultaneously or when only the flankers blinked. In contrast, performance improved dramatically when the target alone blinked despite the continued presence of the flankers. This asymmetric release from crowding occurs across a range of blink durations and target-flanker separations. A similar release was found when the target onset was delayed relative to the flanker onsets, though varying the target offset had little effect. This suggests that blinks (composed of offset and onset events) reduce crowding specifically because they separate target and flanker onsets. Finally, with luminance pedestals added to the Gabors, crowding was reduced by blinks in the target pedestal only when the target Gabor was present; pedestal blinks before/after the stimulus Gabors (as precues/postcues) had no effect. That is, transients do not simply cue the target location. The asymmetry of this effect (reduced crowding with target transients, no effect with flanker transients) also precludes explanations based on similarity or grouping. We attribute our findings to the isolation of the target in transient (vs. sustained) visual channels.},

  Abstract                 = {The functional significance of the �0�2�� rhythm is widely debated. It has been proposed that �0�2�� reflects sensory inhibition and/or a temporal sampling or "parsing" mechanism. There is also continuing disagreement over the more fundamental questions of which cortical layers generate �0�2�� rhythms and whether the generation of �0�2�� is equivalent across sensory systems. To address these latter questions, we analyzed laminar profiles of local field potentials (LFPs) and concomitant multiunit activity (MUA) from macaque V1, S1, and A1 during both spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. Current source density (CSD) analysis of laminar LFP profiles revealed �0�2�� current generators in the supragranular, granular, and infragranular layers. MUA phase-locked to local current source/sink configurations confirmed that �0�2�� rhythms index local neuronal excitability fluctuations. CSD-defined �0�2�� generators were strongest in the supragranular layers, whereas LFP �0�2�� power was greatest in the infragranular layers, consistent with some of the previous reports. The discrepancy between LFP and CSD findings appears to be attributable to contamination of the infragranular LFP signal by activity that is volume-conducted from the stronger supragranular �0�2�� generators. The presence of �0�2�� generators across cortical depth in V1, S1, and A1 suggests the involvement of �0�2�� in feedforward as well as feedback processes and is consistent with the view that �0�2�� rhythms, perhaps in addition to a role in sensory inhibition, may parse sensory input streams in a way that facilitates communication across cortical areas.The �0�2�� rhythm is thought to reflect sensory inhibition and/or a temporal parsing mechanism. Here, we address two outstanding issues: (1) whether �0�2�� is a general mechanism across sensory systems and (2) which cortical layers generate �0�2�� oscillations. Using intracranial recordings from macaque V1, S1, and A1, we show �0�2�� band activity with a similar spectral and laminar profile in each of these sensory areas. Furthermore, �0�2�� generators were present in each of the cortical layers, with a strong source in superficial layers. We argue that previous findings, locating �0�2�� generators exclusively in the deeper layers, were biased because of use of less locally specific local field potential measurements. The laminar distribution of �0�2�� band activity appears more complex than generally assumed.},

Here, we used multicontact laminar probes to revisit the issue of correlated variability in primary visual (V1) cortical circuits. We found that correlations between neurons depend strongly on local network context--whereas neurons in the input (granular) layers showed virtually no correlated variability, neurons in the output layers (supragranular and infragranular) exhibited strong correlations. The laminar dependence of noise correlations is consistent with recurrent models in which neurons in the granular layer receive intracortical inputs from nearby cells, whereas supragranular and infragranular layer neurons receive inputs over larger distances. Contrary to expectation that the output cortical layers encode stimulus information most accurately, we found that the input network offers superior discrimination performance compared to the output networks.},

This article will focus on two experimental approaches by which the control of cortical information processing has been investigated: the study of state-dependent cortical processing in rodents and attention in the primate visual system. Both processes involve a modulation of low-frequency activity fluctuations and spiking correlation, and are mediated by common receptor systems. We suggest that selective attention involves processes that are similar to state change, and that operate at a local columnar level to enhance the representation of otherwise non-salient features while suppressing internally generated activity patterns.},

To dissociate the mechanisms of spatial and feature-based attention, we compared the time course of visually evoked responses under different attention conditions. We recorded from single neurons in area V4 during a delayed match-to-sample task that controlled both spatial and feature-based attention. Neuronal responses increased when spatial attention was directed toward the receptive field and were modulated by the identity of the target of feature-based attention. Modulation by spatial attention was weaker during the early portion of the visual response and stronger during the later portion of the response. In contrast, modulation by feature-based attention was relatively constant throughout the response. It appears that stimulus onset transients disrupt spatial attention, but not feature attention. We conclude that spatial attention reflects a combination of stimulus-driven and goal-driven processes, while feature-based attention is purely goal driven.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensory processing is affected by both endogenous and exogenous mechanisms of attention, although how these mechanisms interact in the brain has remained unclear. In the present study, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate how multiple stages of information processing in the brain are affected when endogenous and exogenous mechanisms are concurrently engaged. We found that the earliest stage of cortical visual processing, the striate-cortex-generated C1, was immune to attentional modulation, even when endogenous and exogenous attention converged on a common location. The earliest stage of processing to be affected in this experiment was the late phase of the extrastriate-cortex-generated P1 component, which was dominated by exogenous attention. Processing at this stage was enhanced by exogenous attention, regardless of where endogenous attention had been oriented. Endogenous attention, however, dominated a later, higher-order stage of processing indexed by an enhancement of the P300 that was unaffected by exogenous attention. Critically, between these early and late stages, an interaction was found wherein endogenous and exogenous attention produced distinct, and overlapping, effects on information processing. At the same time that exogenous attention was producing an extended enhancement of the late-P1, endogenous attention was enhancing the occipital-parietal N1 component. These results provide neurophysiological support for theories suggesting that endogenous and exogenous mechanisms represent two attention systems that can affect information processing in the brain in distinct ways. Furthermore, these data provide new evidence regarding the precise stages of neural processing that are, and are not, affected when endogenous and exogenous attentions interact.},

  Abstract                 = {Bright objects capture our attention by virtue of 'popping out' from their surroundings. This correlates with strong responses in cortical areas thought to be important in attentional allocation. Previous studies have suggested that with the right mindset or training, humans can ignore popout stimuli. We studied the activity of neurons in monkey lateral intraparietal area while monkeys performed a visual search task. The monkeys were free to move their eyes, and a distractor, but never the search target, popped out. On trials in which the monkeys made a saccade directly to the search target, the popout distractor evoked a smaller response than the non-popout distractors. The intensity of the response to the popout correlated inversely with the monkeys' ability to ignore it. We suggest that this modulation corresponds to a top-down mechanism that the brain uses to adjust the parietal representation of salience.},

OFF bipolar cells are shorter in length and use receptors with faster kinetics than ON bipolar cells and, therefore, process information faster. Here, we demonstrate that this temporal advantage is maintained through thalamocortical processing, with OFF visual responses reaching cortex �0�9�0�8�0�43-6 ms before ON visual responses. Faster OFF visual responses could be demonstrated in recordings from large populations of cat thalamic neurons representing the center of vision (both X and Y) and from subpopulations making connection with the same cortical orientation column. While the OFF temporal advantage diminished as visual responses reached their peak, the integral of the impulse response was greater in OFF than ON neurons. Given the stimulus preferences from OFF and ON channels, our results indicate that darks are processed faster than lights in the thalamocortical pathway.},

  Abstract                 = {1. A reverse correlation (6, 8, 25, 35) method is developed that allows quantitative determination of visual receptive-field structure in two spatial dimensions. This method is applied to simple cells in the cat striate cortex. 2. It is demonstrated that the reverse correlation method yields results with several desirable properties, including convergence and reproducibility independent of modest changes in stimulus parameters. 3. In contrast to results obtained with moving stimuli, we find that the bright and dark excitatory subregions in simple receptive fields do not overlap to any great extent. This difference in results may be attributed to confounding the independent variables space and time when using moving stimuli. 4. All simple receptive fields have subregions that vary smoothly in all directions in space. There are no sharp transitions either between excitatory subregions or between subregions and the area surrounding the receptive field. 5. Simple receptive fields vary both in the number of subregions observed, in the elongation of each subregion, and in the overall elongation of the field. In contrast with results obtained using moving stimuli, we find that subregions within a given receptive field need not be the same length. 6. The hypothesis that simple receptive fields can be modeled as either even symmetric or odd symmetric about a central axis is evaluated. This hypothesis is found to be false in general. Most simple receptive fields are neither even symmetric nor odd symmetric. 7. The hypothesis that simple receptive fields can be modeled as the product of a width response profile and an orthogonal length response profile (Cartesian separability) is evaluated. This hypothesis is found to be true for only approximately 50\% of the cells in our sample.},

  Abstract                 = {The dorsolateral prefrontal and the posterior parietal cortex have both been implicated in the guidance of visual attention. Traditionally, posterior parietal cortex has been thought to guide visual bottom-up attention and prefrontal cortex to bias attention through top-down information. More recent studies suggest a parallel time course of activation of the two areas in bottom-up attention tasks, suggesting a common involvement, though these results do not necessarily imply identical roles. To address the specific roles of the two areas, we examined the influence of neuronal activity recorded from the prefrontal and parietal cortex of monkeys as they performed attention tasks based on choice probability and on correlation between reaction time and neuronal activity. The results revealed that posterior parietal but not dorsolateral prefrontal activity correlated with behavioral choice during the fixation period, prior to the appearance of the stimulus, resembling a bias factor. This preferential influence of posterior parietal activity on behavior was transient, so that dorsolateral prefrontal activity predicted choice after the appearance of the stimulus. Additionally, reaction time was better predicted by posterior parietal activity. These findings confirm the involvement of both dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex in the bottom-up guidance of visual attention, but indicate different roles of the two areas in the guidance of attention and a dynamic time course of their effects, influencing behavior at different stages of the task.},

  Abstract                 = {Sleep loss temporarily impairs vigilance and sustained attention. Because these cognitive abilities are believed to be mediated predominantly by the right cerebral hemisphere, this article hypothesized that continuous sleep deprivation results in a greater frequency of inattention errors within the left versus right visual fields. Twenty-one participants were assessed several times each day during a 40-h period of sustained wakefulness and following a night of recovery sleep. At each assessment, participants engaged in a continuous serial addition task while simultaneously monitoring a 150 degrees visual field for brief intermittent flashes of light. Overall, omission errors were most common in the leftmost peripheral field for all sessions, and did not show any evidence of a shift in laterality as a function of sleep deprivation. Relative to rested baseline and postrecovery conditions, sleep deprivation resulted in a global increase in omission errors across all visual locations and a general decline in serial addition performance. These findings argue against the hypothesis that sleep deprivation produces lateralized deficits in attention and suggest instead that deficits in visual attention produced by sleep deprivation are global and bilateral in nature.},

Some trials required a shift of attention, because the target and distractor curves were switched during the course of the trial. We monitored the dynamics of this attention shift in area V1, in which neuronal responses evoked by the target curve are stronger than those evoked by the distractor. The reallocation of attention was associated with a rapid and strong enhancement of responses to the newly attended curve, followed, after approximately 60 ms, by a weaker suppression of responses to the curve from which attention was removed. We conclude that attention can be rapidly allocated to a new object before it disengages from the previously attended one.},

Rhesus monkeys made decisions about the direction of moving random dots, spanning a range of difficulties. They were rewarded for correct decisions. On some trials, after viewing the stimulus, the monkeys could opt out of the direction decision for a small but certain reward.

  Abstract                 = {Sleep deprivation impairs a variety of cognitive abilities including vigilance, attention, and executive function. Although sleep loss has been shown to impair tasks requiring visual attention and spatial perception, it is not clear whether these deficits are exclusively a function of reduced attention and vigilance or if there are also alterations in visuospatial perception. Visuospatial perception and sustained vigilance performance were therefore examined in 54 healthy volunteers at rested baseline and again after one night of sleep deprivation using the Judgment of Line Orientation Test and a computerized test of psychomotor vigilance. Whereas psychomotor vigilance declined significantly from baseline to sleep-deprived testing, scores on the Judgment of Line Orientation did not change significantly. Results suggest that documented performance deficits associated with sleep loss are unlikely to be the result of dysfunction within systems of the brain responsible for simple visuospatial perception and processing of line angles.},

  Abstract                 = {The spike activity of single neurons of the primary visual cortex (V1) becomes more selective and reliable in response to wide-field natural scenes compared to smaller stimuli confined to the classical receptive field (RF). However, it is largely unknown what aspects of natural scenes increase the selectivity of V1 neurons. One hypothesis is that modulation by surround interaction is highly sensitive to small changes in spatiotemporal aspects of RF surround. Such a fine-tuned modulation would enable single neurons to hold information about spatiotemporal sequences of oriented stimuli, which extends the role of V1 neurons as a simple spatiotemporal filter confined to the RF. In the current study, we examined the hypothesis in the V1 of awake behaving monkeys, by testing whether the spike response of single V1 neurons is modulated by temporal interval of spatiotemporal stimulus sequence encompassing inside and outside the RF. We used two identical Gabor stimuli that were sequentially presented with a variable stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA): the preceding one (S1) outside the RF and the following one (S2) in the RF. This stimulus configuration enabled us to examine the spatiotemporal selectivity of response modulation from a focal surround region. Although S1 alone did not evoke spike responses, visual response to S2 was modulated for SOA in the range of tens of milliseconds. These results suggest that V1 neurons participate in processing spatiotemporal sequences of oriented stimuli extending outside the RF.},

This is said to reflect a reflexive shift of attention towards the source of stimulation. After attention is removed from such a peripheral location, there is then delayed responding to stimuli subsequently displayed there. This inhibitory aftereffect, first described in 1984 and later labeled 'inhibition of return (IOR)', encourages orienting towards novel locations and hence might facilitate foraging and other search behaviors. Since its relatively recent discovery, IOR has been the subject of intensive investigation, from many angles and with a wide variety of approaches. After describing the seminal contribution of Posner and Cohen ('Who'), this review will discuss what causes IOR and, once initiated, what effects IOR has on subsequent processing ('What'). The time course ('When') and spatial distribution ('Where') of IOR, and what is known about IOR's neural implementation ('How') and functional significance ('Why') are also discussed.},

Using variants of the model task Posner developed for exploring the control of visual attention we have demonstrated that endogenous shifts of attention are not generated by unexecuted oculomotor activation, that endogenous and exogenous shifts of attention are fundamentally different on a variety of dimensions and that an aftermath of exogenous (but not endogenous) orienting, inhibition of return, facilitates search by encouraging orienting to novel items. A research strategy for understanding ambiguous forms of orienting (e.g., that controlled by conspecific gaze) is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {1. We recorded responses from neurons in area V1 of the alert macaque monkey to textured patterns modeled after stimuli used in psychophysical experiments of pop-out. Neuronal responses to a single oriented line segment placed within a cell's classical receptive field (CRF) were compared with responses in which the center element was surrounded by rings of elements placed entirely outside the CRF. The orientations of the surround elements either matched the center element, were orthogonal to it, or were random. 2. The addition of the textured surround tended to suppress the response to the center element by an average of 34\%. Overall, almost 80\% of the 122 cells analyzed in detail were significantly suppressed by at least one of the texture surrounds. 3. Cells tended to respond more strongly to a stimulus in which there was a contrast in orientation between the center and surround than to a stimulus lacking such contrast. The average difference was 9\% of the response to the optimally oriented center element alone. For the 32\% of the cells showing a statistically significant orientation contrast effect, the average difference was 28\%. 4. Both the general suppression and orientation contrast effects originated from surround regions at the ends of the center bar as well as regions along the sides of the center bar. 5. The amount of suppression induced by the texture surround decreased as the density of the texture elements decreased. 6. Both the general suppression and the orientation contrast effects appeared early in the population response to the stimuli. The general suppression effect took approximately 7 ms to develop, whereas the orientation contrast effect took 18-20 ms to develop. 7. These results are consistent with a possible functional role of V1 cells in the mediation of perceptual pop-out and in the segregation of texture borders. Possible anatomic substrates of the effects are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Nearby cortical neurons often have correlated trial-to-trial response variability, and a significant fraction of their spikes occur synchronously. These two forms of correlation are both believed to arise from common synaptic input, but the origin of this input is unclear. We investigated the source of correlated responsivity by recording from pairs of single neurons in primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaque monkeys and comparing correlated variability and synchrony for spontaneous activity and activity evoked by stimuli of different orientations and contrasts. These two stimulus manipulations would be expected to have different effects on the cortical pool providing input to the recorded pair: changing stimulus orientation should recruit different populations of cells, whereas changing stimulus contrast affects primarily the relative strength of sensory drive and ongoing cortical activity. Consistent with this predicted difference, we found that correlation was affected by these stimulus manipulations in different ways. Synchrony was significantly stronger for orientations that drove both neurons well than for those that did not, but correlation on longer time scales was orientation independent. Reducing stimulus contrast resulted in a decrease in the temporal precision of synchronous firing and an enhancement of correlated response variability on longer time scales. Our results thus suggest that correlated responsivity arises from mechanisms operating at two distinct timescales: one that is orientation tuned and that determines the strength of temporally precise synchrony, and a second that is contrast sensitive, of low temporal frequency, and present in ongoing cortical activity.},

We asked whether this effect could be attributed to a visual attention impairment. In Experiment 1, participants conversed on a telephone or listened to a narrative while engaged in multiple object tracking (MOT), a task requiring sustained visual attention. We found that MOT was disrupted in the telephone conversation condition, relative to single-task MOT performance, but that listening to a narrative had no effect. In Experiment 2, we asked which component of conversation might be interfering with MOT performance. We replicated the conversation and single-task conditions of Experiment 1 and added two conditions in which participants heard a sequence of words over a telephone. In the shadowing condition, participants simply repeated each word in the sequence. In the generation condition, participants were asked to generate a new word based on each word in the sequence. Word generation interfered with MOT performance, but shadowing did not. The data indicate that telephone conversation disrupts attention at a central stage, the act of generating verbal stimuli, rather than at a peripheral stage, such as listening or speaking.},

A square patch of the screen was made to perceptually pop out as a circumscribed figure by virtue of differences between the orientation or the direction of motion of the texture elements within that patch and the surround. The animals were trained to identify the figure patches by making saccadic eye movements towards their positions. Almost every cell gave a significantly larger response to elements belonging to the figure than to similar elements belonging to the background. The figure-ground response enhancement was present along the entire extent of the patch and was absent as soon as the receptive field was outside the patch. The strength of the effect had no relation with classical receptive field properties like orientation or direction selectivity or receptive field size. The response enhancement had a latency of 30-40 msec relative to the onset of the neuronal response itself. The results show that context modulation within primary visual cortex has a highly sophisticated nature, putting the image features the cells are responding to into their fully evaluated perceptual context.},

And the FGM latency is 40 and 30 ms from visual response onset respectively. There is a clear asymmetry of response on two different location of the side of the figure. There is strong FGM on the figure and no FGM or even inhibition on the ground. This asymmetry of response can not be easily explained by the pure machenisms within v1. There is not a clear correlation between the FGM and the RF properties. This modulation may require "intellectual" explainations.},

In this review paper, the authors bring forth the idea that the horizontal (recurrent) and feedback processings play an very important role in visual information processing, espectially fine(detailed) visual information recognitions. The visual system should not be viewed as hierarchical, instead, there is a feedfoward process that is coarse and determines the receptive field properties of a visual area. And there is a delayed, recurrent and feedback process that carries more detailed and more perception related visual information.

There are many literatures of outstanding interest that requires further scrutiny.},

  Abstract                 = {In a backward masking paradigm, a target stimulus is rapidly (<100 msec) followed by a second stimulus. This typically results in a dramatic decrease in the visibility of the target stimulus. It has been shown that masking reduces responses in V1. It is not known, however, which process in V1 is affected by the mask. In the past, we have shown that in V1, modulations of neural activity that are specifically related to figure-ground segregation can be recorded. Here, we recorded from awake macaque monkeys, engaged in a task where they had to detect figures from background in a pattern backward masking paradigm. We show that the V1 figure-ground signals are selectively and fully suppressed at target-mask intervals that psychophysically result in the target being invisible. Initial response transients, signalling the features that make up the scene, are not affected. As figure-ground modulations depend on feedback from extrastriate areas, these results suggest that masking selectively interrupts the recurrent interactions between V1 and higher visual areas.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies have shown that EEG activity in the gamma range can be modulated by attention. Here, we compared this activity for voluntary and involuntary spatial attention in a spatial-cueing paradigm with faces as targets. The stimuli and trial timing were kept constant across attention conditions with only the predictive value of the cue changing. Gamma-band response was linked to voluntary shifts of attention, but not to the involuntary capture of attention. The presence of increased gamma responses for the voluntary allocation of attention, and its absence in cases of involuntary capture suggests that the neural mechanisms governing these two types of attention are different. Moreover, these data allow a description of the temporal dynamics contributing to the dissociation between voluntary and involuntary attention. The distribution of this correlate of voluntary attention is consistent with a top-down process involving contralateral anterior and posterior regions.},

We measure contrast and orientation thresholds for sine-wave gratings, as well uni- and bidirectional offset thresholds for vernier targets. The results suggest that attention selectively lowers some thresholds but not others: orientation thresholds are far more affected than contrast thresholds, and bidirectional vernier thresholds are far more affected than unidirectional thresholds.},

Attention and stimulus contrast both modulate the magnitude of neuronal responses. However, changes in stimulus contrast also affect the latency of visual responses. Although many neurophysiological studies have examined how attention affects the strength of neuronal responses, few have considered whether attention affects neuronal latencies. To compare directly the effects of stimulus contrast and attention, we recorded responses from individual neurons in area V4 of macaque monkeys while they performed a task that independently controlled spatial attention and stimulus contrast. As expected, changes in stimulus contrast affected both the magnitude and latency of neuronal responses. Although attention had the expected effects on the magnitudes of neuronal responses, we did not detect statistically reliable changes in neuronal latency. A direct comparison of the effects of contrast and attention revealed a reliable difference. When a shift in spatial attention decreased response magnitude, response latency increased much less than when the same magnitude change was caused by reducing stimulus contrast. Thus, attention is distinct from contrast in the way it affects the relationship between neuronal response magnitude and latency.},

Based on theoretical reasoning and the experimental evidence, we propose a possible reinterpretation of the functional role of V1. In this framework, because of V1 neurons' precise encoding of orientation and spatial information, higher level perceptual computations and representations that involve high resolution details, fine geometry and spatial precision would necessarily involve V1 and be reflected in the later part of its neurons' activities.},

We found evidence that V1 neurons respond to illusory contours of the Kanizsa figures. The illusory contour signals in V1 are weaker than in V2, but are significant, particularly in the superficial layers. The population averaged response to illusory contours emerged 100 msec after stimulus onset in the superficial layers of V1, and around 120--190 msec in the deep layers. The illusory contour response in V2 began earlier, occurring at 70 msec in the superficial layers and at 95 msec in the deep layers. The temporal sequence of the events suggests that the computation of illusory contours involves intercortical interaction, and that early perceptual organization is likely to be an interactive process.},

  Abstract                 = {The primary visual cortex (V1) is the principal telencephalic recipient of visual input in humans and monkeys. It is unique among cortical areas in that its destruction results in chronic blindness. However, certain patients with V1 damage, though lacking visual awareness, exhibit visually guided behavior: blindsight. This phenomenon, together with evidence from electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and psychophysical experiments, has led to speculation that V1 activity has a special or direct role in generating conscious perception. To explore this issue, this article reviews experiments that have used two powerful paradigms--stimulus-induced perceptual suppression and chronic V1 ablation--each of which disrupts the ability to perceive salient visual stimuli. Focus is placed on recent neurophysiological, behavioral, and functional imaging studies from the nonhuman primate that shed light on V1's role in conscious awareness. In addition, anatomical pathways that relay visual information to the cortex during normal vision and in blindsight are reviewed. Although the critical role of V1 in primate vision follows naturally from its position as a bottleneck of visual signals, little evidence supports its direct contribution to visual awareness.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Visual area V2 of macaque monkey cerebral cortex is the largest of the extrastriate visual areas, yet surprisingly little is known of its neuronal properties. We have made a quantitative analysis of V2 receptive field properties. Our set of measurements was chosen to distinguish neuronal responses reflecting parvocellular (P) or magnocellular (M) inputs and to permit comparison with similar measurements made in other visual areas; we further describe the relationship of those properties to the laminar and cytochrome oxidase (CO) architecture of V2. 2. We recorded the activity of single units representing the central 5 degrees in all laminae and CO divisions of V2 in anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. We studied responses to geometric targets and to drifting sinusoidal gratings that varied in orientation, spatial frequency, drift rate, contrast, and color. 3. The orientation selectivity and spatial and temporal tuning of V2 neurons differed little from those in V1. As in V1, spatial and temporal tuning in V2 appeared separable, and we identified a population of simple cells (more common within the central 3 degrees) similar to those found in V1. Contrast sensitivity of V2 neurons was greater on average than in V1, perhaps reflecting the summation of inputs in V2's larger receptive fields. Many V2 neurons exhibited some degree of chromatic opponency, responding to isoluminant color variations, but these neurons differed from V1 in the linearity with which they summate cone signals. 4. In agreement with others, we found that neurons with selective responses to color, size, and motion did seem to cluster in different CO compartments. However, this segregation of qualitatively different response selectivities was not absolute, and response properties also seemed to depend on laminar position within each compartment. As others also have noted, we found that CO stripe widths in the macaque (unlike in the squirrel monkey) did not consistently appear different. We relied on the segregation of qualitatively distinct cell types, and in some cases the pattern of Cat-301 staining as well, to distinguish CO stripes when the staining pattern of CO alone was ambiguous. Although all cell types were found in all CO compartments and laminae, unoriented cells were more prominent in layers 2-4 of "thin" stripes, direction-selective cells in layers 3B/4 of "thick" stripes, color-selective cells in the upper layers of thin and pale stripes, and end-stopped cells mainly outside of layer 4 in thin stripes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The extent of the IFs is most frequently 2-5 times the size of the RFs. The tuning properties of IFs were studied using an annular surround grating patch while an optimal centre patch was placed at the excitatory RF to continuously activate the cell. The results show that, for most cells, the orientation, spatial frequency and speed tuning of the IFs were similar to, but broader than, the tuning of the RF, whereas the direction selectivity of the IF was not as pronounced as that of the RF. The possible functional significance of the IF is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Hierarchical neural networks have been shown to be effective in learning representative image features and recognizing object classes. However, most existing networks combine the low/middle level cues for classification without accounting for any spatial structures. For applications such as understanding a scene, how the visual cues are spatially distributed in an image becomes essential for successful analysis. This paper extends the framework of deep neural networks by accounting for the structural cues in the visual signals. In particular, two kinds of neural networks have been proposed. First, we develop a multitask deep convolutional network, which simultaneously detects the presence of the target and the geometric attributes (location and orientation) of the target with respect to the region of interest. Second, a recurrent neuron layer is adopted for structured visual detection. The recurrent neurons can deal with the spatial distribution of visible cues belonging to an object whose shape or structure is difficult to explicitly define. Both the networks are demonstrated by the practical task of detecting lane boundaries in traffic scenes. The multitask convolutional neural network provides auxiliary geometric information to help the subsequent modeling of the given lane structures. The recurrent neural network automatically detects lane boundaries, including those areas containing no marks, without any explicit prior knowledge or secondary modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {Our visual system can link components of contours and segregate contours from complex backgrounds based on geometric grouping rules. This is an important intermediate step in object recognition. The substrate for contour integration may be based on contextual interactions and intrinsic horizontal connections seen in primary visual cortex (V1). We examined the perceptual rules governing contour saliency to determine whether the spatial extents of contextual interactions and horizontal connections match those mediating saliency. To quantify these rules, we used stimuli composed of randomly oriented nonoverlapping line segments. Salient contours within this complex background were formed by colinear alignment of nearby segments. Contour detectability was measured using a 2-interval-forced-choice design. Contour detectability deteriorated with increasing spacing between contour elements and improved as the number of colinear line elements was increased. At short contour spacing, the detectability reached a plateau with alignment of a few line segments that together formed a contour subtending several visual degrees. At intermediate spacing, saliency built up progressively with a greater number of colinear lines, extending up to 30 degrees. When contour spacing was beyond a critical range (about 2 degrees ), however, the detectability dropped to chance levels, regardless of the number of colinear lines. Contour detectability was found to be a function not only of the relative spacing of contour elements with respect to the noise elements but also of the average density of the overall pattern. Furthermore, training significantly improved contour detection, increasing the critical spacing of line elements beyond which contours were no longer detectable. Our data suggest that global contour integration is based on mechanisms of limited spatial extent, comparable to the interactions observed in V1. These interactions can cascade over larger distances provided the spacing of stimulus elements is kept within a limited range.},

Here we show that for monkeys trained in a shape discrimination task, V1 neurons took on novel functional properties related to the attributes of the trained shapes. Furthermore, these properties depended on the perceptual task being performed; neurons responded very differently to an identical visual stimulus under different visual discrimination tasks. These top-down influences were seen from the very beginning and throughout the entire time course of the neural responses. Information theoretic analysis showed that neurons carried more information about a stimulus attribute when the animals were performing a task related to that attribute.

  Abstract                 = {Responses of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons to stimuli inside the classic receptive field (CRF) can be modulated by stimuli outside the CRF. We recently reported that responses of most V1 neurons to a line in the CRF center are inhibited by large surround-stimuli and that this modulation is stimulus selective. Here we report that a significant proportion of V1 neurons in alert monkeys respond directly to stimuli outside the CRF with very long latency and much reduced selectivity. When surround stimuli are presented alone, three response patterns can be distinguished in 153 single- or multiunits tested: (1) 31.4\% have no significant response; (2) 50.3\% show excitatory responses that are significantly higher than spontaneous activity. The average latency of these responses is about 145 ms, 2-3 times longer than center responses; (3) 18.3\% show suppressed spontaneous activity after stimulus onset. The direct surround responses are found to be only weakly selective for the orientation of contextual lines, and not selective for other contextual patterns tested. While the outburst of responses to stimuli within the CRF is not affected by reducing stimulus duration from 500 ms to 50 ms, late excitatory surround responses are virtually eliminated. We propose that the late excitatory surround responses to extra-CRF stimulation alone are the reflection of feedback from higher cortical areas and may contribute to reduced contextual inhibition of cells in V1. This could play a role in figure-ground segregation.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied the effects of various patterns as contextual stimuli on human orientation discrimination, and on responses of neurons in V1 of alert monkeys. When a target line is presented along with various contextual stimuli (masks), human orientation discrimination is impaired. For most V1 neurons, responses elicited by a line in the receptive field (RF) center are suppressed by these contextual patterns. Orientation discrimination thresholds of human observers are elevated slightly when the target line is surrounded by orthogonal lines. For randomly oriented lines, thresholds are elevated further and even more so for lines parallel to the target. Correspondingly, responses of most V1 neurons to a line are suppressed. Although contextual lines inhibit the amplitude of orientation tuning functions of most V1 neurons, they do not systematically alter the tuning width. Elevation of human orientation discrimination thresholds decreases with increasing curvature of masking lines, so does the inhibition of V1 neuronal responses. A mask made of straight lines yields the strongest interference with human orientation discrimination and produces the strongest suppression of neuronal responses. Elevation of human orientation discrimination thresholds is highest when a mask covers only the immediate vicinity of the target line. Increasing the masking area results in less interference. On the contrary, suppression of neuronal responses in V1 increases with increasing mask size. Our data imply that contextual interference observed in human orientation discrimination is in part directly related to contextual inhibition of neuronal activity in V1. However, the finding that interference with orientation discrimination is weaker for larger masks suggests a figure-ground segregation process that is not located in V1.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous literature suggests that low-level stimulus properties determine the detection performance of contours and are used to define different contour types. Here we investigated the processing of different types of contours under conscious and unconscious conditions. In Experiment 1, we adopted an inattentional blindness paradigm and showed that collinear contours (i.e., a contour type that is frequently observed in natural images) induced a positive cuing effect in both the conscious and unconscious conditions, whereas orthogonal contours (which are less prevalent in the natural environment) attracted attention only when consciously perceived. In Experiment 2, we showed that collinear contours rendered invisible by continuous flash suppression emerged from suppression more rapidly than a random field, whereas orthogonal contours had no such breaking superiority. These results suggest that collinear but not orthogonal contours can be processed and serve as attentional cues without conscious awareness. Our findings provide further evidence that the relevance of the contours to natural statistics could be a key evolutionary factor that decides whether a contour can be unconsciously processed to increase its detectability in a clutter environment.},

Hence no separate feature maps, or any subsequent combination of them, is needed to create a saliency map. I use a model to show that this saliency map accounts for the way that the relative difficulties of visual search tasks depend on the features and spatial configurations of targets and distractors. This proposal links psychophysical behavior to V1 physiology and anatomy, and thereby makes testable predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {Most prior studies on selective attention in the setting of total sleep deprivation (SD) have focused on behavior or activation within fronto-parietal cognitive control areas. Here, we evaluated the effects of SD on the top-down biasing of activation of ventral visual cortex and on functional connectivity between cognitive control and other brain regions.Twenty-three healthy young adult volunteers underwent fMRI after a normal night of sleep (RW) and after sleep deprivation in a counterbalanced manner while performing a selective attention task. During this task, pictures of houses or faces were randomly interleaved among scrambled images. Across different blocks, volunteers responded to house but not face pictures, face but not house pictures, or passively viewed pictures without responding. The appearance of task-relevant pictures was unpredictable in this paradigm. SD resulted in less accurate detection of target pictures without affecting the mean false alarm rate or response time. In addition to a reduction of fronto-parietal activation, attending to houses strongly modulated parahippocampal place area (PPA) activation during RW, but this attention-driven biasing of PPA activation was abolished following SD. Additionally, SD resulted in a significant decrement in functional connectivity between the PPA and two cognitive control areas, the left intraparietal sulcus and the left inferior frontal lobe.SD impairs selective attention as evidenced by reduced selectivity in PPA activation. Further, reduction in fronto-parietal and ventral visual task-related activation suggests that it also affects sustained attention. Reductions in functional connectivity may be an important additional imaging parameter to consider in characterizing the effects of sleep deprivation on cognition.},

These modifications of network connectivity should lead to changes in neuronal activity as a particular stimulus is repeatedly encountered. Here we ask what plasticity rules are consistent with the differences in the statistics of the visual response to novel and familiar stimuli in inferior temporal cortex, an area underlying visual object recognition. We introduce a method that allows one to infer the dependence of the presumptive learning rule on postsynaptic firing rate, and we show that the inferred learning rule exhibits depression for low postsynaptic rates and potentiation for high rates. The threshold separating depression from potentiation is strongly correlated with both mean and s.d. of the firing rate distribution. Finally, we show that network models implementing a rule extracted from data show stable learning dynamics and lead to sparser representations of stimuli.},

The aim of this study was twofold: (1) Using a zero-noise display, we assessed whether sustained (endogenous) attention enhances contrast sensitivity via signal enhancement, and compared the magnitude of the effect with that of transient (exogenous) attention. (2) We compared the contrast psychometric functions for both sustained and transient attention and evaluated them in terms of contrast gain and response gain models. Observers performed a 2AFC orientation discrimination task on a tilted target Gabor, presented alone at 1 of 8 iso-eccentric locations. Either a neutral (baseline), peripheral (to manipulate transient attention), or a central cue (to manipulate sustained attention) preceded the target. Even in the absence of external noise, and using suprathreshold stimuli, observers showed an attentional effect, evidence in support of signal enhancement underlying both sustained and transient attention. Moreover, sustained attention caused a strictly leftward threshold shift in the psychometric function, supporting a contrast gain model. Interestingly, with transient attention we observed a change in asymptote in addition to a threshold shift. These findings suggest that whereas sustained attention operates strictly via contrast gain, transient attention may be better described by a mixture of response gain and contrast gain.},

However, comprehensive characterization of RFs beyond the primary visual cortex (V1) remains a challenge. Here we report fine RF structures in secondary visual cortex (V2) of awake macaque monkeys, identified through a projection pursuit regression analysis of neuronal responses to natural images. We found that V2 RFs could be broadly classified as V1-like (typical Gabor-shaped subunits), ultralong (subunits with high aspect ratios), or complex-shaped (subunits with multiple oriented components). Furthermore, single-unit recordings from functional domains identified by intrinsic optical imaging showed that neurons with ultralong RFs were primarily localized within pale stripes, whereas neurons with complex-shaped RFs were more concentrated in thin stripes. Thus, by combining single-unit recording with optical imaging and a computational approach, we identified RF subunits underlying spatial feature selectivity of V2 neurons and demonstrated the functional organization of these RF properties.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of local and global attributes of symmetric patterns on the perceptual salience of symmetry was investigated. After tachistoscopic viewing, subjects discriminated between symmetric and either random patterns (experiment 1) or their perturbed counterparts (experiment 2) created by replacing one third of the mirror element-pairs of symmetric stimuli with 'random' elements. In general, it was found that perceptibility of symmetry, measured by response time and detection accuracy, was not influenced in a consistent way by type of pattern element (dots or line segments oriented vertically, horizontally, obliquely, or in all three orientations about the symmetry axis). Nor did axis orientation (vertical, horizontal, oblique), advance knowledge of axis orientation, practice effects, or subject sophistication differentially affect detection. A highly salient global percept of symmetry emerged, on the other hand, when elements were clustered together within a pattern, or grouped in symmetric pairs along a single symmetry axis or two orthogonal axes. Results suggest that mirror symmetry is detected preattentively, presumably by some kind of integral code which emerges from the interaction between display elements and the way they are organized spatially. It is proposed that symmetry is coded and signalled by the same spatial grouping processes as those responsible for construction of the full primal sketch.},

  Abstract                 = {Visual object recognition is of fundamental importance to most animals. The diversity of tasks that any biological recognition system must solve suggests that object recognition is not a single, general purpose process. In this review, we consider evidence from the fields of psychology, neuropsychology, and neurophysiology, all of which supports the idea that there are multiple systems for recognition. Data from normal adults, infants, animals, and brain damaged patients reveal a major distinction between the classification of objects at a basic category level and the identification of individual objects from a homogeneous object class. An additional distinction between object representations used for visual perception and those used for visually guided movements provides further support for a multiplicity of visual recognition systems. Recent evidence from psychophysical and neurophysiological studies indicates that one system may represent objects by combinations of multiple views, or aspects, and another may represent objects by structural primitives and their spatial interrelationships.},

  Abstract                 = {Many neurons in extrastriate visual cortex have large receptive fields, and this may lead to significant computational problems whenever multiple stimuli fall within a single field. Previous studies have suggested that when multiple stimuli fall within a cell's receptive field, they compete for the cell's response in a manner that can be biased in favor of attended stimuli. In the present study we examined this role of attention in areas V1, V2, and V4 of macaque monkeys with the use of a behavioral paradigm in which attention was directed to one of two stimulus locations. When two stimuli were presented simultaneously inside the cell's receptive field (which could be accomplished only in areas V2 and V4), we found that the cell's response was strongly influenced by which of the two stimuli was attended. The size of this attention effect was reduced when the attended and ignored stimuli were presented sequentially rather than simultaneously. In addition, the effects became very weak and inconsistent in these areas when only one of the two stimuli was located inside the receptive field. Attention thus modulated sensory responses primarily when two or more simultaneous stimuli competed for access to a neuron's receptive field. As in areas V2 and V4, attention did not modulate sensory responses in area V1 when only a single stimulus was inside the receptive field. In addition, the small receptive fields in this area precluded the simultaneous presentation of attended and ignored stimuli inside the receptive field, making it impossible to determine whether attention effects would be observed under the conditions that led to consistent attention effects in areas V2 and V4. Spontaneous firing rates in areas V2 and V4 were found to be 30-40\% higher when attention was directed inside rather than outside the receptive field, even when no stimulus was present in the receptive field. Spontaneous firing rates also varied according to the particular location within the receptive field that was attended. These shifts in spontaneous activity may reflect a top-down signal that biases responses in favor of stimuli at the attended location.},

  Abstract                 = {I hope that this review of the internal anatomy of the monkey primary visual cortex makes clear the high degree of specialization that exists in each of the cortical laminae and their constituent neurons. Each lamina is driven by different patterns of relays from the LGN and by different patterns of intrinsic interlaminar projections. The elaborate laminar and intralaminar segregation of efferent neuron arrays suggests that the extraordinary precision of inter- and intralaminar connectivity provides a unique functional role for each set of efferent neurons. The organization of aspinous (presumed inhibitory) local circuit neurons suggests that they are highly specialized, and within each lamina and via interlaminar relays each variety may only accomplish a single, particular task. The cortex neuropil does not give the immediate impression of "random" networks, and if such exist, they must surely be between very tightly determined subgroups of neurons. Clearly a very detailed physiological exploration of V1 is still needed, with new consideration of thalamic axon function, of efferent neuron characteristics, of laminar differences, and of spatial organization of properties within laminae, in order to match known anatomical detail with function. The concept of columnar organization in cortical organization of V1 may eventually be redefined in more complex terms that accurately describe the anatomical and functional parcellation evident in cortical depth and perhaps may link it to a means by which a correlation of different aspects of the visual image is achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {In this review we re-examine the concept of a cortical column in macaque primary visual cortex, and consider to what extent a functionally defined column reflects any sort of anatomical entity that subdivides cortical territory. Functional studies have shown that columns relating to different response properties are mapped in cortex at different spatial scales. We suggest that these properties first emerge in mid-layer 4C through a combination of thalamic afferent inputs and local intracortical circuitry, and are then transferred to other layers in a columnar fashion, via interlaminar relays, where additional processing occurs. However, several properties are not strictly columnar since they do not appear in all cortical layers. In contrast to the functional column, an anatomically based cortical column is defined most clearly in terms of the reciprocal connections it makes, both via intra-areal lateral connections and inter-areal feedback/feedforward pathways. The column boundaries are reinforced by interplay between lateral inhibition spreading beyond the column boundary and disinhibition within the column. The anatomical column acts as a functionally tuned unit and point of information collation from laterally offset regions and feedback pathways. Thalamic inputs provide the high-contrast receptive field sizes of the column's neurons, intra-areal lateral connections provide their low contrast summation field sizes, and feedback pathways provide surround modulation of receptive fields responses.},

This class of illusions, known as visual masking, may allow insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie visual perception. We have therefore explored the temporal characteristics of masking illusions in humans, and compared them with corresponding neuronal responses in the primary visual cortex of awake and anesthetized monkeys. Stimulus parameters that in humans produce forward masking (in which the mask precedes the target) suppress the transient on-response to the target in monkey visual cortex. Those that produce backward masking (in which the mask comes after the target) inhibit the transient after-discharge, the excitatory response that occurs just after the disappearance of the target. These results suggest that, for targets that can be masked (those of short duration), the transient neuronal responses associated with onset and turning off of the target may be important in its visibility.},

In order to properly segment the image into figure and background, boundary interpolation is required even across large distances. Here we study the cortical mechanisms involved in collinear contour interpolation using fMRI. Human observers were asked to discriminate the curvature of interpolated boundaries in Kanizsa figures and in control configurations, which contained identical physical information but did not generated subjective shapes. We measured a spatially precise spin-echo BOLD signal and found stronger responses to subjective shapes than non-shapes at the subjective boundary locations, but not at the inducer locations. The responses to subjective contours within primary visual cortex were retinotopically specific and analogous to that to real contours, which is intriguing given that subjective and luminance-defined contours are physically fundamentally different. We suggest that in the absence of retinal stimulation, the observed activation changes in primary visual cortex are driven by intracortical interactions and feedback, which are revealed in the absence of a physical stimulus.},

  Abstract                 = {A fundamental issue in cortical processing of sensory information is whether top-down control circuits from higher brain areas to primary sensory areas not only modulate but actively engage in perception. Here, we report the identification of a neural circuit for top-down control in the mouse somatosensory system. The circuit consisted of a long-range reciprocal projection between M2 secondary motor cortex and S1 primary somatosensory cortex. In�0�0�0�2vivo physiological recordings revealed that sensory stimulation induced sequential S1 to M2 followed by M2 to S1 neural activity. The top-down projection from M2 to S1 initiated dendritic spikes and persistent firing of S1 layer 5 (L5) neurons. Optogenetic inhibition of M2 input to S1 decreased L5 firing and the accurate perception of tactile surfaces. These findings demonstrate that recurrent input to sensory areas is essential for accurate perception and provide a physiological model for one type of top-down control circuit.},

The effects of non-predictive (50\% valid and 50\% invalid) and predictive (80\% valid and 20\% invalid) peripheral visual cues on reaction times and response accuracy to a target stimulus, using Stimuli-Onset Asynchronies (SOAs) varying between 200 and 1,200 ms, were investigated. The results showed shorter reaction times in valid trials relative to invalid trials for both subjects trained in the non-predictive and predictive conditions, particularly when the SOAs were 200 and 400 ms. However, the magnitude of this validity effect was significantly greater for subjects exposed to predictive cues, when the SOA was 800 ms. Subjects exposed to invalid predictive cues exhibited an increase in omission errors relative to subjects exposed to invalid non-predictive cues. In contrast, valid cues reduced the proportion of omission errors for subjects trained in the predictive condition relative to subjects trained in the non-predictive condition. These results are congruent with those usually reported for humans and indicate that, in addition to the exogenous capture of attention promoted by both predictive and non-predictive peripheral cues, rats exposed to predictive cues engaged an additional slower process equivalent to human's endogenous orienting of attention. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an endogenous-like process of covert orienting of visual attention in rats.},

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to map the boundaries of retinotopic visual areas and to localize attention-related changes in neural activity within several of those areas, including primary visual (striate) cortex. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and modeling of their neural sources, however, indicated that the initial sensory input to striate cortex at 50-55 milliseconds after the stimulus was not modulated by attention. The earliest facilitation of attended signals was observed in extrastriate visual areas, at 70-75 milliseconds. We hypothesize that the striate cortex modulation found with fMRI may represent a delayed, re-entrant feedback from higher visual areas or a sustained biasing of striate cortical neurons during attention. ERP recordings provide critical temporal information for analyzing the functional neuroanatomy of visual attention.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Many lines of evidence suggest that signals relayed by the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the primate lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) maintain their segregation in cortical processing. We have examined two response properties of units in the striate cortex of macaque monkeys, latency and transience, with the goal of assessing whether they might be used to infer specific geniculate contributions. Recordings were made from 298 isolated units and 1,129 multiunit sites in the striate cortex in four monkeys. Excitotoxin lesions that selectively affected one or the other LGN subdivision were made in three animals to demonstrate directly the magnocellular and parvocellular contributions. An additional 435 single units and 551 multiunit sites were recorded after the ablations. 2. Most units in striate cortex had visual response latencies in the range of 30-50 ms under the stimulus conditions used. The earliest neuronal responses in striate cortex differed appreciably between individuals. The shortest latency recorded in the four animals ranged from 20 to 31 ms. Comparable values were obtained from both single unit and multiunit sites. After lesions were made in the magnocellular subdivision of the LGN in two animals, the shortest response latencies were 7 and 10 ms later than before the ablations. A larger lesion in the parvocellular subdivision of another animal produced no such shift. Thus it appears that the first 7-10 ms of cortical activation can be attributed to activation relayed by the magnocellular layers of the LGN. 3. The units with the shortest latencies were all found in layers 4C or 6 and their responses were among the most transient in striate cortex. Furthermore, their responses all showed a pronounced periodicity at a frequency of 50-100 Hz. This periodicity was stimulus locked, and the responses of all short-latency units oscillated in phase. 4. An index of response transience was computed for the units recorded in striate cortex. The distribution of this index was unimodal and gave no suggestion of distinct contributions from the geniculate subdivisions. Magnocellular and the parvocellular lesions affected the overall transience of responses in striate cortex. The changes, however, were very small; extremely transient responses and extremely sustained responses survived both types of lesions. 5. A characteristic profile was observed in the response latencies in superficial layers. Latencies appeared to increase monotonically from layer 4 toward the surface of cortex, with the most superficial neurons not becoming active until 15 ms after responses were observed in layer 4C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Attention to a visual stimulus typically increases the responses of cortical neurons to that stimulus. Because many studies have shown a close relationship between the performance of individual neurons and behavioural performance of animal subjects, it is important to consider how attention affects this relationship. Measurements of behavioural and neuronal performance taken from rhesus monkeys while they performed a motion detection task with two attentional states show that attention alters the relationship between behaviour and neuronal response. Notably, attention affects the relationship differently in different cortical visual areas. This indicates that a close relationship between neuronal and behavioural performance on a given task persists over changes in attentional state only within limited regions of visual cortex.},

The effect takes the form of an inability to respond quickly to a stimulus appearing in the same location in the visual periphery as a previous one that produced covert orienting. Several characteristics of the effect are revealed that eliminate possible explanations in terms of response inhibition, masking, and sensory habituation. The inhibitory component of orienting occurs whether or not the first stimulus requires a response (Experiment 1), lasts at least a second (Experiments 1, 2, and 3), affects not only the originally stimulated location but also nearby locations (Experiment 2), is determined by environmental coordinates (Experiment 3), and occurs both in the periphery and at the fovea (Experiment 4). It is concluded that inhibition may act together with an early facilitatory component (Posner & Cohen, 1984) in directing the attention and eye movement systems in order to maintain efficient spatial sampling.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to derive meaning from complex sensory input requires the integration of information over space and time, as well as cognitive mechanisms to shape that integration. We studied these processes in the primary visual cortex (V1), where neurons are thought to integrate visual inputs along contours defined by an association field (AF). We recorded extracellularly from single cells in macaque V1 to map the AF, by using an optimization algorithm to find the contours that maximally activated individual cells. We combined the algorithm with a delayed-match-to-sample task, to test how the optimal contours might be molded by the monkey's expectation for particular cue shapes. We found that V1 neurons were selective for complex shapes, a property previously ascribed to higher cortical areas. Furthermore, the shape selectivity was reprogrammed by perceptual task: Over the whole network, the optimal modes of geometric selectivity shifted between distinct subsets of the AF, alternately representing different stimulus features known to predominate in natural scenes. Our results suggest a general model of cortical function, whereby horizontal connections provide a broad domain of potential associations, and top-down inputs dynamically gate these linkages to task switch the function of a network.},

Here, the effects of ATD on psychomotor processing, declarative memory, working memory, executive functions and attention are discussed. The most robust finding is that ATD impairs the consolidation of episodic memory for verbal information. Semantic memory appears to be unaffected by ATD although a limited variety of tasks examined effects in this domain. Similarly, evidence suggests ATD does not influence verbal, spatial and affective working memory. Most studies investigating effects on executive functions have produced non-specific or negative findings. In terms of attention, ATD either does not affect or may improve focused attention and ATD likely does not impact sustained and divided attention or attentional set-shifting. Although ATD is known to affect mood in certain vulnerable populations, the effects of ATD on cognition in non-vulnerable participants are independent of mood changes. Suggestions for future directions and implications for psychiatric illnesses are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Ibotenic acid lesions were made in four macaque monkeys in a region of cortical area V4 that corresponds to the lower quadrant of one hemifield. For visual testing, fixation locus was monitored with scleral search coils and controlled behaviorally to place test stimuli either in the lesioned quadrant or in a control location in the opposite hemifield. Some basic visual capacities were slightly altered by the lesions; there was a two-fold reduction of luminance contrast sensitivity as well as red-green chromatic contrast sensitivity, both tested with stationary gratings. On the other hand, little or no loss was found when contrast sensitivity for detection or direction discrimination was tested with 10-Hz drifting gratings nor was there a reliable change in visual acuity. Hue and luminance matching were tested with a spatially more complex matching-to-sample task, but monkeys could not learn this task in the visual field locus of a V4 lesion. If previously trained at this locus, performance was not affected by the lesion. In contrast to the small effects on basic visual capabilities, performance on two form discrimination tasks was devastated by V4 lesions. The first involved discriminating the orientation of colinear groups of dots on a background of randomly placed dots. The second involved discriminating the orientation of a group of three line segments surrounded by differently oriented line segments. Some selectivity of the deficits for form discrimination was shown by the lack of an effect of the lesions on a global motion discrimination. These results show that while V4 lesions cause only slight disruptions of basic visual capacities, they profoundly disrupt form discriminations.},

Impermeable plastic contact lenses have been used to prevent dehydration of the corneal epithelium, which would otherwise occur in minutes. Unfortunately, such lenses rapidly introduce a variety of abnormal states that lead to clouding of the cornea, degradation of the retinal image, and premature termination of the experiment. To extend the viability of such preparations, a new protocol for maintenance of corneal health has been developed. The protocol uses rigid gas permeable contact lenses designed to maximize gas transmission, rigorous sterile methods, and a variety of methods for sustaining and monitoring the overall physiology of the animal. The effectiveness of the protocol was evaluated clinically by ophthalmoscopy before, during, and after the experiments, which lasted 8-10 days. Histopathology and quantitative histology were performed on the corneas following the experiment. Our observations showed that this protocol permits continuous contact lens wear without adversely affecting the corneas. Thus, it is possible to collect data 24 h each day, for the entire duration of the experiment.},

Here, we examine the possibility that more reliable task performance could arise in part because observers learn to sample information from a larger portion of the stimulus. We used a variant of the classification image method in combination with a global orientation discrimination task to test whether a change in information sampling underlies training-based benefits in behavioral performance. The results revealed that decreases in orientation thresholds with perceptual learning were accompanied by increases in stimulus sampling. In particular, while stimulus sampling was restricted to the parafoveal, inner portion of the stimulus before training, we observed an outward spread of sampling after training. These results demonstrate that the benefits of perceptual learning may arise, in part, from a strategic increase in the efficiency with which the observer samples information from a visual stimulus.},

Because only a small fraction of V1 neurons projects to MT, we wished to establish the processing hierarchy more precisely by studying the properties of those neurons projecting to MT, identified by antidromic responses to electrical stimulation of MT. The neurons that project from V1 to MT were directionally selective and, like other V1 neurons, responded only to the motion of the components of complex patterns. The projection neurons were predominantly "special complex," responsive to a broad range of spatial and temporal frequencies, and sensitive to very low stimulus contrasts. The projection neurons thus comprise a homogeneous and highly specialized subset of V1 neurons, consistent with the notion that V1 acts as clearing house of basic visual measurements, distributing information appropriately to higher cortical areas for specialized analysis.},

To further examine this issue, we independently manipulated exogenous and endogenous attention and measured the rate of perceptual learning of oriented Gabor patches presented in different quadrants of the visual field. In this way, we could track learning at attended, divided-attended, and unattended locations. We also measured contrast thresholds of the Gabor patches before and after training. Our results showed that, for both exogenous and endogenous attention, accuracy in performing the orientation discrimination improved to a greater extent at attended than at unattended locations. Importantly, however, only exogenous attention resulted in improved contrast thresholds. These findings suggest that both exogenous and endogenous attention facilitate perceptual learning, but that these two types of attention may be mediated by different neural mechanisms.},

Instead, visual completion and seeing are increasingly conceived as active processes, dependent on information exchange across neural populations. How this is instantiated in the brain remains controversial. Divergent models emanate from single-unit and population-level electrophysiology, neuroimaging, and neurostimulation studies. We reconcile discrepant findings from different methods and disciplines, and underscore the importance of taking into account spatiotemporal brain dynamics in generating models of brain function and perception.},

Peripheral and central cues are believed to activate different reflexive and voluntary modes of orienting (Jonides, 1981; Posner, 1980). Experiment 1 showed that the time courses of facilitation and inhibition from peripheral and central cues were characteristic and different. Experiment 2 showed that voluntary orienting in response to symbolic central cues is interrupted by reflexive orienting to random peripheral flashes. Experiment 3 showed that irrelevant peripheral flashes also compete with relevant peripheral cues. The amount of interference varied systematically with the interval between the onset of the relevant cue and of the distracting flash (cue-flash onset asynchrony) and with the cuing condition. Taken together, these effects support a model for spatial attention with distinct but interacting reflexive and voluntary orienting mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Human observers fixated the center of a search array and were required to discriminate the color of an odd target if it was present. The array consisted of horizontal or vertical black or white bars. In the simple case, only orientation was necessary to define the odd target, whereas in the conjunctive case, both orientation and color were necessary. A cue located at the critical target position was either visible all the time (sustained cuing) or it appeared at a short variable delay before the array presentation (transient cuing). Sustained visual cuing enhanced perception greatly in the conjunctive, but not in the simple condition. Perception of the odd target in the conjunctive display was improved even further by transient cuing, and peak discrimination performance occurred if the cue preceded the target array by 70-150 msec. Longer delays led to a marked downturn in performance. Control experiments indicated that this transient attentional component was independent of the observers' prior knowledge of target position and was not subject to voluntary control. We provide evidence to suggest that the transient component does not originate at the earliest stages of visual processing, since it could not be extended in duration by flickering the cue, nor did it require a local sensory transient to trigger its onset. Neither the variation in retinal eccentricity nor changing the paradigm to a vernier acuity task altered the basic pattern of results. Our findings indicate the existence of a sustained and a transient component of attention, and we hypothesize that of the two, the transient component is operative at an earlier stage of visual cortical processing.},

Consistent with previous studies, we found that response rank order to the most- and least-preferred stimuli was preserved throughout the receptive field. However, a fine-grained analysis of shape tuning revealed a surprising result: V4 neurons tuned to highly curved shapes exhibit very limited translation invariance. At a fine spatial scale, these neurons exhibit local variation in orientation. In contrast, neurons that prefer straight contours exhibit spatially invariant orientation-tuning and homogenous fine-scale orientation maps. Both of these patterns are consistent with a simple orientation-pooling model, with tuning for straight or curved shapes resulting, respectively, from pooling of homogenous or heterogeneous orientation signals inherited from early visual areas.},

The main conclusion is that the earlist visual response is in layer 4Ca and 4B of V1. And the supergranular layers of V1 and V2 has similar response latencies. The infragranular layers of V1 and V2 also has similar response latencies. This suggest that these two areas are working in a interactive manner or shared the common concurrent inputs.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous work showed that trichloroethylene (TCE) impairs sustained attention as evidenced by a reduction in accuracy and elevation of response latencies in rats trained to perform a visual signal detection task (SDT). This work also showed that these effects abate during repeated exposures if rats inhale TCE while performing the SDT. The present experiment sought to determine whether toluene, another commonly-used solvent, would induce tolerance similarly if inhaled repeatedly during SDT testing. Sixteen male, Long-Evans rats were trained to perform the SDT. Upon completion of training, rats were divided into 2 groups. In Phase I, concentration-effect functions were determined for toluene (0, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400 ppm) in both groups. Toluene reduced the proportion of correct responses [P(correct)], and increased response time (RT) and response failures. In Phase II, Group-Tol inhaled 1600 ppm toluene while Group-Air inhaled clean air during 11 daily SDT sessions. In Group-Tol the effect of toluene on P(correct) abated after 3 days, while RT remained elevated for the duration of the repeated exposures. In Phase III, toluene concentration-effect functions were re-determined for both groups. Group-Air remained impaired on all test measures, whereas for Group-Tol, toluene did not reduce P(correct), but continued to increase RT. These data confirm our previous hypothesis that animals can develop tolerance to chemical exposures that impair appetitively-motivated behaviors if that impairment leads to loss of reinforcement.},

We have previously found that many macaque V4 neurons are tuned for the curvature and object-centered position of boundary fragments (such as 'concavity on the right'). Here we tested the hypothesis that populations of such cells represent complete shapes as aggregates of boundary fragments. To estimate the population representation of a given shape, we scaled each cell's tuning peak by its response to that shape, summed across cells and smoothed. The resulting population response surface contained 3-8 peaks that represented major boundary features and could be used to reconstruct (approximately) the original shape. This exemplifies how a multi-peaked neural population response can represent a complex stimulus in terms of its constituent elements.},

The mechanisms by which local shape signals from V1 are transformed into selectivity for abstract object categories in IT are unknown. One approach to this issue is to investigate shape representation at intermediate stages in the pathway, such as area V4. We studied 109 V4 cells that appeared sensitive to complex shape in preliminary tests. To achieve a more complete picture of shape representation in V4, we tested each cell with a set of 366 stimuli, constructed by systematically combining convex and concave boundary elements into closed shapes. Using this large, diverse stimulus set, we found that all the cells in our sample responded to a wide variety of shapes and did not appear to encode any single type of global shape. However, for most cells the shapes evoking strongest responses were characterized by a consistent type of boundary conformation at a specific position within the stimulus. For example, a given cell might be tuned for shapes containing concave curvature at the right, with other parts of the shape having little or no effect on responses. Many cells were tuned for more complex boundary configurations (e.g., a convex angle adjacent to a concave curve). We quantified this kind of shape tuning with Gaussian functions on a curvature x position domain. These tuning functions fit the neural responses much better than tuning functions based on edge or axis orientation. Thus individual V4 cells appear to encode moderately complex boundary information at specific locations within larger shapes. This finding suggests that, at intermediate stages in the V1-IT transformation, complex objects are represented at least partly in terms of the configurations and positions of their contour components.},

Area V4 is an important intermediate stage in this pathway, and provides the major input to the final stages in inferotemporal cortex. The role of V4 in processing shape information is not yet clear. We studied V4 responses to contour features (angles and curves), which many theorists have proposed as intermediate shape primitives. We used a large parametric set of contour features to test the responses of 152 V4 cells in two awake macaque monkeys. Most cells responded better to contour features than to edges or bars, and about one-third exhibited systematic tuning for contour features. In particular, many cells were selective for contour feature orientation, responding to angles and curves pointing in a particular direction. There was a strong bias toward convex (as opposed to concave) features, implying a neural basis for the well-known perceptual dominance of convexity. Our results suggest that V4 processes information about contour features as a step toward complex shape recognition.},

  Abstract                 = {Transient covert attention increases contrast sensitivity at the target location with an informative spatial cue. Here we explored whether an uninformative spatial cue (50\% valid with two possible locations) also increases contrast sensitivity and whether contrast sensitivity is altered at the uncued location as compared to the neutral condition. For all four observers, transient covert attention had both a benefit and a cost: it enhanced contrast sensitivity at the cued location and impaired contrast sensitivity at the uncued location at both parafoveal and peripheral positions. These results are consistent with the idea of limited resources, and indicate that transient attention helps control the expenditure of cortical computation.},

  Abstract                 = {What is the relationship between top-down and bottom-up attention? Are both types of attention tightly interconnected, or are they independent? We investigated this by testing a large representative sample of the Dutch population on two attentional tasks: a visual search task gauging the efficiency of top-down attention and a singleton capture task gauging bottom-up attention. On both tasks we found typical performance--i.e., participants displayed a significant search slope on the search task and significant slowing caused by the unique, but irrelevant, object on the capture task. Moreover, the high levels of significance we observed indicate that the current set-up provided very high signal to noise ratios, and thus enough power to accurately unveil existing effects. Importantly, in this robust investigation we did not observe any correlation in performance between tasks. The use of Bayesian statistics strongly confirmed that performance on both tasks was uncorrelated. We argue that the current results suggest that there are two attentional systems that operate independently. We hypothesize that this may have implications beyond our understanding of attention. For instance, it may be that attention and consciousness are intertwined differently for top-down attention than for bottom-up attention.},

  Abstract                 = {The visual system encodes the features of visual stimuli as well as their behavioral relevance. Stimuli with a high luminance contrast evoke more activity in the visual cortex than stimuli with a low contrast. At the same time, attended stimuli evoke more activity than nonattended stimuli. There is a debate about how visual features and attention jointly determine neuronal activity in the visual cortex. Some studies suggested that attention increases apparent contrast (Reynolds et al., 2000), others that attention amplifies responses by a constant factor (Williford and Maunsell, 2006), and yet others that attention and contrast have largely additive effects (Buracas and Boynton, 2007; Thiele et al., 2009). The influence of attention on contrast sensitivity differs between neurons, raising the possibility that attention and contrast could be coded conjointly in a population of neurons. Here we investigate this possibility by recording neuronal activity at multiple sites in the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys using multielectrode recording techniques and support vector machines to decode attended stimuli as well as stimulus contrast. We find that many, but not all, V1 neurons are influenced by attention and that the effects of attention and contrast are additive on average. Stimulus contrast can be decoded from neuronal responses not strongly modulated by attention, whereas the attended stimulus can be decoded as the difference in activity of cells that are influenced by attention and cells that are not. The success of the approach suggests that visual attention and stimulus contrast are represented by largely separable codes.},

  Abstract                 = {Detection of a visual signal requires information to reach a system capable of eliciting arbitrary responses required by the experimenter. Detection latencies are reduced when subjects receive a cue that indicates where in the visual field the signal will occur. This shift in efficiency appears to be due to an alignment (orienting) of the central attentional system with the pathways to be activated by the visual input. It would also be possible to describe these results as being due to a reduced criterion at the expected target position. However, this description ignores important constraints about the way in which expectancy improves performance. First, when subjects are cued on each trial, they show stronger expectancy effects than when a probable position is held constant for a block, indicating the active nature of the expectancy. Second, while information on spatial position improves performance, information on the form of the stimulus does not. Third, expectancy may lead to improvements in latency without a reduction in accuracy. Fourth, there appears to be little ability to lower the criterion at two positions that are not spatially contiguous. A framework involving the employment of a limited-capacity attentional mechanism seems to capture these constraints better than the more general language of criterion setting. Using this framework, we find that attention shifts are not closely related to the saccadic eye movement system. For luminance detection the retina appears to be equipotential with respect to attention shifts, since costs to unexpected stimuli are similar whether foveal or peripheral. These results appear to provide an important model system for the study of the relationship between attention and the structure of the visual system.},

We manipulated lateral pulvinar neural activity in prosimian primates and assessed the effect on supra-granular layers of V1 that project to higher visual cortex. Reversibly inactivating lateral pulvinar prevented supra-granular V1 neurons from responding to visual stimulation. Reversible, focal excitation of lateral pulvinar receptive fields increased the visual responses in coincident V1 receptive fields fourfold and shifted partially overlapping V1 receptive fields toward the center of excitation. V1 responses to regions surrounding the excited lateral pulvinar receptive fields were suppressed. LGN responses were unaffected by these lateral pulvinar manipulations. Excitation of lateral pulvinar after LGN lesion activated supra-granular layer V1 neurons. Thus, lateral pulvinar is able to powerfully control and gate information outflow from V1.},

A subset of neurons responsible for carrying the residual errors showed endstopping and other extra-classical receptive-field effects.

  Abstract                 = {A growing number of studies suggest that early visual processing is not only affected by low-level perceptual attributes but also by higher order cognitive factors such as attention or emotion. Using high-density electroencephalography, we recently demonstrated that attentional load of a task at fixation reduces the response of primary visual cortex to irrelevant peripheral stimuli, as indexed by the C1 component. In the latter study, peripheral stimuli were always presented during intervals without task-relevant stimuli. Here, we use a similar paradigm but present central task stimuli and irrelevant peripheral stimuli simultaneously while keeping all other stimulus characteristics constant. Results show that rather than to suppress responses to peripheral stimulation, high attentional load elicits higher C1 amplitudes under these conditions. These findings suggest that stimulus timing can profoundly alter the effects of attentional load on the earliest stages of processing in human visual cortex.},

  Abstract                 = {A decision is a commitment to a proposition or plan of action based on evidence and the expected costs and benefits associated with the outcome. Progress in a variety of fields has led to a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms that evaluate evidence and reach a decision. Several formalisms propose that a representation of noisy evidence is evaluated against a criterion to produce a decision. Without additional evidence, however, these formalisms fail to explain why a decision-maker would change their mind. Here we extend a model, developed to account for both the timing and the accuracy of the initial decision, to explain subsequent changes of mind. Subjects made decisions about a noisy visual stimulus, which they indicated by moving a handle. Although they received no additional information after initiating their movement, their hand trajectories betrayed a change of mind in some trials. We propose that noisy evidence is accumulated over time until it reaches a criterion level, or bound, which determines the initial decision, and that the brain exploits information that is in the processing pipeline when the initial decision is made to subsequently either reverse or reaffirm the initial decision. The model explains both the frequency of changes of mind as well as their dependence on both task difficulty and whether the initial decision was accurate or erroneous. The theoretical and experimental findings advance the understanding of decision-making to the highly flexible and cognitive acts of vacillation and self-correction.},

  Abstract                 = {Single-unit recording studies in the macaque have carefully documented the modulatory effects of attention on the response properties of visual cortical neurons. Attention produces qualitatively different effects on firing rate, depending on whether a stimulus appears alone or accompanied by distracters. Studies of contrast gain control in anesthetized mammals have found parallel patterns of results when the luminance contrast of a stimulus increases. This finding suggests that attention has co-opted the circuits that mediate contrast gain control and that it operates by increasing the effective contrast of the attended stimulus. Consistent with this idea, microstimulation of the frontal eye fields, one of several areas that control the allocation of spatial attention, induces spatially local increases in sensitivity both at the behavioral level and among neurons in area V4, where endogenously generated attention increases contrast sensitivity. Studies in the slice have begun to explain how modulatory signals might cause such increases in sensitivity.},

To test conflicting predictions of these alternative models, we recorded responses of V4 neurons to stimuli across a range of luminance contrasts and measured the change in response when monkeys attended to them in order to discriminate a target stimulus from nontargets. Attention caused greater increases in response at low contrast than at high contrast, consistent with an increase in effective stimulus strength. On average, attention increased the effective contrast of the attended stimulus by a factor of 1.51, an increase of 51\% of its physical contrast.},

  Abstract                 = {1. To understand some of the contributions of parietal cortex to the dynamics of visual spatial attention, we recorded from cortical cells of monkeys performing attentional tasks. We studied 484 neurons in the intraparietal sulcus and adjacent gyral tissue of two monkeys. We measured phasic responses to peripheral visual stimuli while the monkeys attended toward or away from the stimuli or when attention was not controlled. Neurons were tested while the monkeys gazed at a spot of light (simple fixation task), actively attended to a foveal target (foveal attention task), performed a reaction time task (cued reaction time task), made saccadic eye movements to visual targets (saccade task), or responded to a repetitious peripheral target (probability task). 2. In a previous paper we demonstrated that monkeys, like humans, responded more quickly to visual targets when the targets followed briefly flashed visual cues (validly cued targets) (Bowman et al. 1993). It has been hypothesized that the cue attracts attention to its locus and results in faster reaction times (Posner 1980). In the present physiological studies, visual cues consistently excited these neurons when they were flashed in the receptive field. Such activity might signal a shift of attention. Visual targets that fell within the receptive field and that immediately followed the cue evoked relatively weak responses. This response was due to a relative refractory period. 3. Next we tested attentional processes in these tasks that were independent of the visual response to the cue. We placed the cue outside of the receptive field and the target within the receptive field. We found that 23\% of these cells had a significant decrease in their firing rate to validly cued targets in their receptive fields under these conditions. Strong responses were evoked by the same target when the cue was flashed in the opposite hemifield (invalidly cued targets). Thus this group of neurons responded best when attention was directed toward the opposite hemifield. 4. For another group of parietal cells (13\%) there was an enhanced response to targets in the visual receptive field when the cue was in the same hemifield. For the remaining 64\% of the cells there was no significant modulation in this task. 5. The cued reaction time task involved exogenous control of attention; the sensory cue gave spatial and temporal direction to attention. We used several other tasks to test for endogenous control of attention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {1. The present experiments were conducted to study physiological mechanisms in the superior colliculus and their relation to visual spatial attention. We used a cued reaction time task studied in detail previously (Bowman et al. 1993; Posner 1980). Monkeys learned to fixate a spot of light and release a bar when a target light appeared. Cues on the same side as the target (valid cue) were associated with faster reaction times than those on the opposite side (invalid cue). The difference in reaction times is hypothesized to be a measure of attention. 2. A total of 79 neurons within the superficial layers of the superior colliculi of two monkeys were studied. When the cues and targets were positioned so that both were within the visual receptive field, the cues excited the cells, and this produced a refractoriness to the targets for the following 400 ms. Both the ON and OFF responses to the cue were constant under all conditions. 3. These neurons were also tested with the cue just outside of the visual receptive field. This was done to avoid refractory effects from the cue; there was no significant modulation of the response to the target under these conditions. The visual responses of neurons in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus also responded equivalently under these conditions. 4. When the activity of cells within the foveal representation was compared during the performance of three tasks, there was differential activity. The appearance of the fixation point during the performance of the cued reaction time task led to a strong, transient discharge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

We now show that, unlike interactions within V1, V1-V2 orientation interactions are much less synchronized and are not necessarily orientation dependent. We find V1-V2 orientation networks are of two types: a more tightly synchronized, orientation-preserving network and a less synchronized orientation-diverse network. We suggest that such diversity of V1-V2 interactions underlies the spatial and functional integration required for computation of higher order contour and shape in V2.},

  Abstract                 = {A fundamental task of vision is to group the image elements that belong to one object and to segregate them from other objects and the background. This review provides a conceptual framework of how perceptual grouping may be implemented in the visual cortex. According to this framework, two mechanisms are responsible for perceptual grouping: base-grouping and incremental grouping. Base-groupings are coded by single neurons tuned to multiple features, like the combination of a color and an orientation. They are computed rapidly because they reflect the selectivity of feedforward connections. However, not all conceivable feature combinations are coded by dedicated neurons. Therefore, a second, flexible form of grouping is required called incremental grouping. Incremental grouping enhances the responses of neurons coding features that are bound in perception, but it takes more time than does base-grouping because it relies also on horizontal and feedback connections. The modulation of neuronal response strength during incremental grouping has a correlate in psychology because attention is directed to those features that are labeled by the enhanced neuronal response.},

Base grouping and incremental grouping. Incremental grouping happens in multiple visual areas channeled by the intra-areal recurrent and inter-areal feedforward and feedback connections. Neurons with their RFs located on an object is labeled by enhanced firing rate irrespective to their feature selectivity. Object attention can be guided in a similar fashion, but must be gated by the stimulus.},

  Abstract                 = {Spontaneous activity plays an important role in the function of neural circuits. Although many similarities between spontaneous and sensory-evoked neocortical activity have been reported, little is known about consistent differences between them. Here, using simultaneously recorded cortical populations and morphologically identified pyramidal cells, we compare the laminar structure of spontaneous and sensory-evoked population activity in rat auditory cortex. Spontaneous and evoked patterns both exhibited sparse, spatially localized activity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, with densely distributed activity in larger layer 5 pyramidal cells and putative interneurons. However, the propagation of spontaneous and evoked activity differed, with spontaneous activity spreading upward from deep layers and slowly across columns, but sensory responses initiating in presumptive thalamorecipient layers, spreading rapidly across columns. The similarity of sparseness patterns for both neural events and distinct spread of activity may reflect similarity of local processing and differences in the flow of information through cortical circuits, respectively.},

It is commonly assumed that the brain constructs its percept of the visual scene from information encoded in the selective responses of such neurons. We have now tested this hypothesis directly by measuring the effect on psychophysical performance of modifying the firing rates of physiologically characterized neurons. We required rhesus monkeys to report the direction of motion in a visual display while we electrically stimulated clusters of directionally selective neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT, or V5), an extrastriate area that plays a prominent role in the analysis of visual motion information. Microstimulation biased the animals' judgements towards the direction of motion encoded by the stimulated neurons. This result indicates that physiological properties measured at the neuronal level can be causally related to a specific aspect of perceptual performance.},

A democracy of sensory neurons discriminate the properties of a stimulus, while competition contrasts the attributes of stimuli across the visual field to locate conspicuous stimuli.

Experimentally combining neural and mental chronometry has determined the contribution of perceptual and motor processes to the duration and variability of behavioral reaction time. Whereas perceptual processing occupies a relatively constant amount of time for a given stimulus condition, the processes of mapping particular stimuli onto the appropriate behavior and preparing the motor response provide flexibility but introduce delay and variability in reaction time.},

The major deficit observed was a loss in the ability, after V4 lesions, to select such less prominent stimuli; this was the case irrespective of the manner in which the stimulus arrays were made visible, using either luminance, chrominance, motion, or stereoscopic depth as surface media. In addition, V4 lesions yielded mild deficits in color, brightness, and form vision whereas MT lesions yielded mild to moderate deficits in motion and flicker perception. Both lesions produced mild deficits in contrast sensitivity, shape-from-motion perception, and yielded increased reaction times on many of the tasks. The impairment resulting from combined V4 and MT lesions was not greater than the sum of the deficits of either lesion. None of the lesions produced significant deficits in stereopsis. The findings suggest that (1) area V4 is part of a neural system that is involved in extracting stimuli from the visual scene that elicit less neural activity early in the visual system than do other stimuli with which they appear and (2) several other extrastriate regions and more than just two major cortical processing streams contribute to the processing of basic visual functions in the extrastriate cortex.},

We investigated the anatomic mechanisms of multisensory convergence by examining three areas in which convergence occurs, posterior auditory association cortex, superior temporal polysensory area (STP) and ventral intraparietal sulcus area (VIP). The first of these was recently shown to be a site of multisensory convergence and the latter two are more well known as 'classic' multisensory regions. In each case, we focused on defining the laminar profile of response to the unisensory inputs. This information is useful because two major types of connection, feedforward and feedback, have characteristic differences in laminar termination patterns, which manifest physiologically. In the same multisensory convergence areas we also examined the timing of the unisensory inputs using the same standardized stimuli across all recordings. Our findings indicate that: (1) like somatosensory input [J. Neurophysiol., 85 (2001) 1322], visual input is available at very early stages of auditory processing, (2) convergence occurs through feedback, as well as feedforward anatomical projections and (3) input timing may be an asset, as well as a constraint in multisensory processing.},

Laminar profiles of postsynaptic potentials and action potentials were indexed with current source density (CSD) and multiunit activity profiles respectively. Locally, we found contrasting activation profiles in dorsal and ventral stream areas. The former, like V1 and V2, exhibit a 'feedforward' profile, with excitation beginning at the depth of Lamina 4, followed by activation of the extragranular laminae. The latter often displayed a multilaminar/columnar profile, with initial responses distributed across the laminae and reflecting modulation rather than excitation; CSD components were accompanied by either no changes or by suppression of action potentials. System-wide, response latencies indicated a large dorsal/ventral stream latency advantage, which generalizes across a wide range of methods. This predicts a specific temporal ordering of dorsal and ventral stream components of visual analysis, as well as specific patterns of dorsal-ventral stream interaction. Our findings support a hierarchical model of cortical organization that combines serial and parallel elements. Critical in such a model is the recognition that processing within a location typically entails multiple temporal components or 'waves' of activity, driven by input conveyed over heterogeneous pathways from the retina.},

  Abstract                 = {What roles do the different cortical layers play in visual processing? We recorded simultaneously from all layers of the primary visual cortex while monkeys performed a figure-ground segregation task. This task can be divided into different subprocesses that are thought to engage feedforward, horizontal, and feedback processes at different time points. These different connection types have different patterns of laminar terminations in V1 and can therefore be distinguished with laminar recordings.We found that the visual response started 40 ms after stimulus presentation in layers 4 and 6, which are targets of feedforward connections from the lateral geniculate nucleus and distribute activity to the other layers. Boundary detection started shortly after the visual response. In this phase, boundaries of the figure induced synaptic currents and stronger neuronal responses in upper layer 4 and the superficial layers ~70 ms after stimulus onset, consistent with the hypothesis that they are detected by horizontal connections. In the next phase, ~30 ms later, synaptic inputs arrived in layers 1, 2, and 5 that receive feedback from higher visual areas, which caused the filling in of the representation of the entire figure with enhanced neuronal activity.The present results reveal unique contributions of the different cortical layers to the formation of a visual percept. This new blueprint of laminar processing may generalize to other tasks and to other areas of the cerebral cortex, where the layers are likely to have roles similar to those in area V1.},

In this paper the authors used linear laminar probe to test the V1 neuronal reponse of macaque monkey while performing an orientation defined figure ground segregation task. The FGM was most prominent in the supergranular and infragranular layers. And is much weaker in the layer 4. The authers used CSD analysis to compare between figure and ground. And have seen a very early edge component in supergranular layers, which is very different from the widespread MUA activity. We should try CSD method too, also LFP could give us much more information. The visual latency of the stimulus used in this paper was earlist in layer 4 and layer 5. Much later in supergranular layers.},

  Abstract                 = {The primate visual system offers unprecedented opportunities for investigating the neural basis of cognition. Even the simplest visual discrimination task requires processing of sensory signals, formation of a decision, and orchestration of a motor response. With our extensive knowledge of the primate visual and oculomotor systems as a base, it is now possible to investigate the neural basis of simple visual decisions that link sensation to action. Here we describe an initial study of neural responses in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the cerebral cortex while alert monkeys discriminated the direction of motion in a visual display. A subset of LIP neurons carried high-level signals that may comprise a neural correlate of the decision process in our task. These signals are neither sensory nor motor in the strictest sense; rather they appear to reflect integration of sensory signals toward a decision appropriate for guiding movement. If this ultimately proves to be the case, several fascinating issues in cognitive neuroscience will be brought under rigorous physiological scrutiny.},

This review describes statistical methods that can be used to characterize neural feature selectivity, focusing on the case of natural stimuli. First, we discuss how such classic methods as reverse correlation/spike-triggered average and spike-triggered covariance can be generalized for use with natural stimuli to find the multiple relevant stimulus features that affect the responses of a given neuron. Second, ways to characterize neural feature selectivity while assuming that the neural responses exhibit a certain type of invariance, such as position invariance for visual neurons, are discussed. Finally, we discuss methods that do not require one to make an assumption of invariance and instead can determine the type of invariance by analyzing relationships between the multiple stimulus features that affect the neural responses.},

  Abstract                 = {The visual areas of the temporal lobe of the primate are thought to be essential for the representation of visual objects. To examine the role of these areas in the visual awareness of a stimulus, we recorded the activity of single neurons in monkeys trained to report their percepts when viewing ambiguous stimuli. Visual ambiguity was induced by presenting incongruent images to the two eyes, a stimulation condition known to instigate binocular rivalry, during which one image is seen at a given time while the other is perceptually suppressed. Previous recordings in areas V1, V2, V4, and MT of monkeys experiencing binocular rivalry showed that only a small proportion of striate and early extrastriate neurons discharge exclusively when the driving stimulus is seen. In contrast, the activity of almost all neurons in the inferior temporal cortex and the visual areas of the cortex of superior temporal sulcus was found to be contingent upon the perceptual dominance of an effective visual stimulus. These areas thus appear to represent a stage of processing beyond the resolution of ambiguities--and thus beyond the processes of perceptual grouping and image segmentation--where neural activity reflects the brain's internal view of objects, rather than the effects of the retinal stimulus on cells encoding simple visual features or shape primitives.},

The controversy occurs partially because most VPL studies have examined correlations between behavioral and neural activity changes rather than cause-and-effect relationships. With an online-feedback method that uses decoded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, we induced activity patterns only in early visual cortex corresponding to an orientation without stimulus presentation or participants' awareness of what was to be learned. The induced activation caused VPL specific to the orientation. These results suggest that early visual areas are so plastic that mere inductions of activity patterns are sufficient to cause VPL. This technique can induce plasticity in a highly selective manner, potentially leading to powerful training and rehabilitative protocols.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most frequently applied methods to study abnormal cognition is the Continuous Performance Task (CPT). It is unclear, however, which cognitive functions are engaged in normal CPT performance. The aims of the present study were to identify the neurocognitive functions engaged in the main variants of the CPT and to determine to what extent these variants differentially engage these functions. We hypothesized that the main CPT versions (CPT-X, CPT-AX, CPT-Identical Pairs) can be distinguished by whether they demand sustained or transient attention and sustained or transient response preparation. Transient attention to objects like letters or digits, that is, the need to switch attention to different objects from trial to trial, impairs target detection accuracy relative to sustained attention to a single object. Transient response preparation, that is, the possibility to switch response preparation on and off from trial to trial, improves response speed relative to having to sustain response preparation across all trials. Comparison of task performance and Event-Related brain Potentials (ERPs) of healthy participants obtained in the main CPT variants confirmed these hypotheses. Behavioral and ERP measures indicated worse target detection in the CPT-AX than in the CPT-X, consistent with a higher demand on transient attention in that task. In contrast, behavioral and ERP measures indicated higher response speed in the CPT-AX than in the CPT-X, associated with more response preparation in advance of the targets. This supports the idea of increased transient response preparation in the CPT-AX. We conclude that CPTs differ along at least two task variables that each influences a different cognitive function.},

  Abstract                 = {The spiking activity of cortical neurons is correlated. For instance, trial-to-trial fluctuations in response strength are shared between neurons, and spikes often occur synchronously. Understanding the properties and mechanisms that generate these forms of correlation is critical for determining their role in cortical processing. We therefore investigated the spatial extent and functional specificity of correlated spontaneous and evoked activity. Because feedforward, recurrent, and feedback pathways have distinct extents and specificity, we reasoned that these measurements could elucidate the contribution of each type of input. We recorded single unit activity with microelectrode arrays which allowed us to measure correlation in many hundreds of pairings, across a large range of spatial scales. Our data show that correlated evoked activity is generated by two mechanisms that link neurons with similar orientation preferences on different spatial scales: one with high temporal precision and a limited spatial extent (approximately 3 mm), and a second that gives rise to correlation on a slow time scale and extends as far as we were able to measure (10 mm). The former is consistent with common input provided by horizontal connections; the latter likely involves feedback from extrastriate cortex. Spontaneous activity was correlated over a similar spatial extent, but approximately twice as strongly as evoked activity. Visual stimuli thus caused a substantial decrease in correlation, particularly at response onset. These properties and the circuit mechanism they imply provide new constraints on the functional role that correlation may play in visual processing.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the mammalian neocortex has a clear laminar organization, layer-specific neuronal computations remain to be uncovered. Several studies suggest that gamma band activity in primary visual cortex (V1) is produced in granular and superficial layers and is associated with the processing of visual input. Oscillatory alpha band activity in deeper layers has been proposed to modulate neuronal excitability associated with changes in arousal and cognitive factors. To investigate the layer-specific interplay between these two phenomena, we characterized the coupling between alpha and gamma band activity of the local field potential in V1 of the awake macaque. Using multicontact laminar electrodes to measure spontaneous signals simultaneously from all layers of V1, we found a robust coupling between alpha phase in the deeper layers and gamma amplitude in granular and superficial layers. Moreover, the power in the two frequency bands was anticorrelated. Taken together, these findings demonstrate robust interlaminar cross-frequency coupling in the visual cortex, supporting the view that neuronal activity in the alpha frequency range phasically modulates processing in the cortical microcircuit in a top-down manner.},

  Abstract                 = {Disappointment entails the recognition that one did not get the value expected. In contrast, regret entails recognition that an alternative (counterfactual) action would have produced a more valued outcome. In humans, the orbitofrontal cortex is active during expressions of regret, and humans with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex do not express regret. In rats and nonhuman primates, both the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum have been implicated in reward computations. We recorded neural ensembles from orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum in rats encountering wait or skip choices for delayed delivery of different flavors using an economic framework. Economically, encountering a high-cost choice after skipping a low-cost choice should induce regret. In these situations, rats looked backwards toward the lost option, cells within orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum represented the missed action, rats were more likely to wait for the long delay, and rats rushed through eating the food after that delay.},

Here we show that a late (> 100-ms) component of the neural activity in the primary visual cortex of the monkey is selectively suppressed when stimuli are not seen. As there is evidence that this activity depends on feedback from extrastriate areas, these findings suggest a specific role for recurrent processing when stimuli are reaching a perceptual level. Further results show that this perceptual level is situated between purely sensory and decision or motor stages of processing.},

Here we investigated the mechanisms of attention in the striate cortex of monkeys performing a spatial or an object-based attention task at various stimulus contrasts and compared neuronal contrast response functions with and without attention. Our data are best described by an "additive" interaction: The influence of attention on the neuronal response is relatively independent of the stimulus contrast, at least when the stimulus has enough contrast to become visible. This shows that attention adds to the neuronal responses in a largely contrast invariant manner. These data support recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies and suggest that feedback from higher areas exerts a constant attentional drive that is mostly task not stimulus driven.},

Further details regarding neuron type (stellate or pyramidal), size class, and spatial grouping of the cells making these corticocortical connections also were obtained. All interareal connections are reciprocal. Ipsilaterally, such connections exist between areas 17 and 18, 17 and MT, 18 and 19, 18 and MT, and 19 and MT. In addition, areas 18, 19, and MT receive association fibers from the ipsilateral frontal eye field; when combined with previous findings, these results indicate the existence of reciprocal connections between area 18 and the frontal eye field and between area MT and the frontal eye field. Each of areas 18, 19, and MT. Area 17 has only weak callosal connections. Both the ipsilateral and the contralateral connections are topographically organized such that they obey a hodological principle of visuotopic connectivity: that is, only representations of the same part of the visual field are interconnected. With regard to layers of origin, the callosal neurons of these visual areas conform to the general concept of corticocortical fibers arising from supragranular layers in that most of them are located in layer IIIb; only a few of them reside at the junction between layers V and VI. On the other hand, for all the visuocortical connections investigated, the anteriormost area of a reciprocally interconnected pair has its association neurons located predominantly in the infragranular layers while the posteriormost area has its association neurons located primarily in layer III. All callosal fibers and most association fibers arise from pyramidal cells. The callosal cells are larger and reside at a deeper level in layer III than neurons with ipsilateral corticocortical connections. However, some of the association cells at the junction of layers V and VI in area 17 which project to area MT are relatively large and may include the solitary cells of Meynert; but medium-sized pyramidal cells also participate in this projection. In area 17, some association neurons in layers IIIb and IIIc which project to area 18, as well as some in layer IIIc which project to area MT, are most likely stellate cells. Several different patterns of cell groupings were observed for the central representation interconnections. Neither ipsilateral area MT nor any of the contralateral visuocortical areas had multiple groupings of labeled neurons. The ipsilateral projections from area 17 to 18, 17 to MT, and 18 to 19 were arranged similarly according to a plan involving separate, multiple loci of origin for cells projecting to a small and isolated subregion of the central representation in the target cortical area; following larger injections, cells throughout the central representation of the projecting cortex were labeled...},

Specifically, exogenous cues were presented to the left and right of neutral, pleasant and unpleasant picture stimuli. In contrast to the experimental hypothesis, pleasant and unpleasant pictures failed to affect attention to exogenous cues despite slowing overall reaction times in comparison to neutral pictures. This null finding was replicated in a further experiment where rate arousal was varied within the pleasant and unpleasant picture groups. However, unpleasant pictures produced more task interference than pleasant pictures and highly arousing pictures produced more interference than pictures rated low in arousal.},

Although many studies have investigated the role of attention in shaping neuronal representations in the visual cortex, few have focused on attentional modulation of neuronal signals related to visual motion. Here we report that the responses of direction-selective neurons in monkey visual cortex are greatly influenced by attention, and that this modulation occurs as early in the cortical hierarchy as the level of the middle temporal visual area (MT). Our finding demonstrates a stronger and earlier influence of attention on motion processing along the dorsal visual pathway than previously recognized.},

On the other hand, perception of random-dot symmetry is still possible at isoluminance. The reason for this difference appears to be the need for exact-position information in movement but not symmetry perception.

Here we report on a powerful variant of existing techniques, continuous flash suppression. Distinct images flashed successively at approximately 10 Hz into one eye reliably suppress an image presented to the other eye. The duration of perceptual suppression is at least ten times greater than that produced by binocular rivalry. Using this tool we show that the strength of the negative afterimage of an adaptor was reduced by half when it was perceptually suppressed by input from the other eye. The more completely the adaptor was suppressed, the more strongly the afterimage intensity was reduced. Paradoxically, trial-to-trial visibility of the adaptor did not correlate with the degree of reduction. Our results imply that formation of afterimages involves neuronal structures that access input from both eyes but that do not correspond directly to the neuronal correlates of perceptual awareness.},

  Abstract                 = {It is generally agreed that basal forebrain neuronal circuits contribute to the mediation of the ability to detect, select and discriminate signals, to suppress the processing of irrelevant information, and to allocate processing resources to competing tasks. Rats were trained in a task designed to assess sustained attention, or in a cued discrimination task that did not tax attentional processes. Animals were equipped with guide cannula to infuse bilaterally antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) against the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) NR1 subunits, or missense ODNs, into the substantia innominata of the basal forebrain. Infusions of antisense or missense ODNs did not affect cued visual discrimination performance. Infusions of antisense ODNs dose-dependently impaired sustained attention performance by selectively decreasing the animals' ability to detect signals while their ability to reject nonsignal trials remained unchanged. The detrimental attentional effects of antisense infusions were maximal 24 h after the third and final infusion, and performance returned to baseline 24 h later. Missense infusions did not affect attentional performance. Separate experiments demonstrated extensive suppression of NR1 subunit immunoreactivity in the substantia innominata. Furthermore, infusions of antisense did not produce neurotoxic effects in that region as demonstrated by the Fluoro-Jade METHOD: The present data support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor (NMDAR) stimulation in the basal forebrain, largely via glutamatergic inputs originating in the prefrontal cortex, represents a necessary mechanism to activate the basal forebrain corticopetal system for mediation of attentional performance.},

By comparing connectomes derived from simple to more advanced species, we identify two conserved themes of wiring: the tendency to organize network topology into communities that serve specialized functionality and the general drive to enable high topological integration by means of investment of neural resources in short communication paths, hubs, and rich clubs. Within the space of wiring possibilities that conform to these common principles, we argue that differences in connectome organization between closely related species support adaptations in cognition and behavior.},

To overcome this constraint, we developed new devices that integrate ultrathin and flexible silicon nanomembrane transistors into the electrode array, enabling new dense arrays of thousands of amplified and multiplexed sensors that are connected using fewer wires. We used this system to record spatial properties of cat brain activity in vivo, including sleep spindles, single-trial visual evoked responses and electrographic seizures. We found that seizures may manifest as recurrent spiral waves that propagate in the neocortex.

When confronted by a predator-mimicking looming stimulus, a fly responds with either a long-duration escape behavior sequence that initiates stable flight or a distinct, short-duration sequence that sacrifices flight stability for speed. Intracellular recording of the descending giant fiber (GF) interneuron during head-fixed escape revealed that GF spike timing relative to parallel circuits for escape actions determined which of the two behavioral responses was elicited. The process was well described by a simple model in which the GF circuit has a higher activation threshold than the parallel circuits, but can override ongoing behavior to force a short takeoff. Our findings suggest a neural mechanism for action selection in which relative activation timing of parallel circuits creates the appropriate motor output.},

The major part of the article consists of a critical examination of the extensive literature about the effects on symmetry detection of several major factors such as the orientation of the symmetry axis, the location of the stimulus in the visual field, grouping, and perturbations. Constraints on plausible models of symmetry detection are derived from this rich database and several proposals are evaluated against it. As a result of bringing this research together, open questions and remaining gaps to be filled by future research are identified.},

In this paper, the literature about these nonaccidental properties (NAPs) is reviewed to trace its historical roots, to list the properties that function as NAPs, and to discuss the psychological evidence for their detection and use. Against this background, four experiments are reviewed and four are fully described that were designed to test the perceptual use of skewed symmetry (SS), which results from orthographic projection of planar bilateral or mirror symmetry (BS). Despite the large symmetry advantage obtained in all experiments, SS is only perceived as BS-in-depth in cases of closed polygons or dot patterns with higher-order types of symmetry. In all random dot patterns and in some symmetric patterns with low "Gestalt", subjects relied on more local groupings which are qualitatively affine invariant, such as clusters based on proximity or curvilinearity. Based on previous approaches in the literature and these new findings, I suggest some distinctions between different ways of using NAPs, which might foster further research.},

In addition to the first-order regularities of orientational uniformity and midpoint collinearity (Jenkins, 1983), bilateral symmetry (BS) gives rise to second-order relations between two pairs of symmetric elements (represented by correlation quadrangles). We suggest that they allow the regularity (i.e., BS) to emerge simply as a result of the position-based grouping that takes place normally, so that no special symmetry-detection mechanism has to be postulated. In combination with previously investigated variables--number and orientation of axes--we introduced skewing (resulting from orthographic projection of BS) to manipulate the kind and number of higher order regularities. In agreement with our predictions, the data show that the effect of skewing angle (varied at three 15 degrees steps, clockwise and counterclockwise) on the preattentive detectability of symmetry (measured with d') increases as the number of axes decreases. On the basis of some more specific findings, we suggest that it is not as much the number of correlation quadrangles that determines the saliency of a regularity as it is the degree to which they facilitate or "bootstrap" each other.},

  Abstract                 = {Visual perception is influenced by attention deployed voluntarily or triggered involuntarily by salient stimuli. Modulation of visual cortical processing by voluntary or endogenous attention has been extensively studied, but much less is known about how involuntary or exogenous attention affects responses of visual cortical neurons. Using implanted microelectrode arrays, we examined the effects of exogenous attention on neuronal responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake monkeys. A bright annular cue was flashed either around the receptive fields of recorded neurons or in the opposite visual field to capture attention. A subsequent grating stimulus probed the cue-induced effects. In a fixation task, when the cue-to-probe stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was <240 ms, the cue induced a transient increase of neuronal responses to the probe at the cued location during 40-100 ms after the onset of neuronal responses to the probe. This facilitation diminished and disappeared after repeated presentations of the same cue but recurred for a new cue of a different color. In another task to detect the probe, relative shortening of monkey's reaction times for the validly cued probe depended on the SOA in a way similar to the cue-induced V1 facilitation, and the behavioral and physiological cueing effects remained after repeated practice. Flashing two cues simultaneously in the two opposite visual fields weakened or diminished both the physiological and behavioral cueing effects. Our findings indicate that exogenous attention significantly modulates V1 responses and that the modulation strength depends on both novelty and task relevance of the stimulus.Visual attention can be involuntarily captured by a sudden appearance of a conspicuous object, allowing rapid reactions to unexpected events of significance. The current study discovered a correlate of this effect in monkey primary visual cortex. An abrupt, salient, flash enhanced neuronal responses, and shortened the animal's reaction time, to a subsequent visual probe stimulus at the same location. However, the enhancement of the neural responses diminished after repeated exposures to this flash if the animal was not required to react to the probe. Moreover, a second, simultaneous, flash at another location weakened the neuronal and behavioral effects of the first one. These findings revealed, beyond the observations reported so far, the effects of exogenous attention in the brain.},

  Abstract                 = {Humans can learn to abstract and conceptualize the shared visual features defining an object category in object learning. Therefore, learning is generalizable to transformations of familiar objects and even to new objects that differ in other physical properties. In contrast, visual perceptual learning (VPL), improvement in discriminating fine differences of a basic visual feature through training, is commonly regarded as specific and low-level learning because the improvement often disappears when the trained stimulus is simply relocated or rotated in the visual field. Such location and orientation specificity is taken as evidence for neural plasticity in primary visual cortex (V1) or improved readout of V1 signals. However, new training methods have shown complete VPL transfer across stimulus locations and orientations, suggesting the involvement of high-level cognitive processes. Here we report that VPL bears similar properties of object learning. Specifically, we found that orientation discrimination learning is completely transferrable between luminance gratings initially encoded in V1 and bilaterally symmetric dot patterns encoded in higher visual cortex. Similarly, motion direction discrimination learning is transferable between first- and second-order motion signals. These results suggest that VPL can take place at a conceptual level and generalize to stimuli with different physical properties. Our findings thus reconcile perceptual and object learning into a unified framework.Training in object recognition can produce a learning effect that is applicable to new viewing conditions or even to new objects with different physical properties. However, perceptual learning has long been regarded as a low-level form of learning because of its specificity to the trained stimulus conditions. Here we demonstrate with new training tactics that visual perceptual learning is completely transferrable between distinct physical stimuli.

  Abstract                 = {Increased striatal dopamine D2 receptor activity is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. To model this condition in mice, Kellendonk et al. (2006) generated transgenic mice that selectively overexpress the D2 receptor in striatum (D2OE). Drew et al. (2007) reported that D2OE mice display deficits in interval timing and motivation. The present study further explored the impaired timing in D2OE mice. Experiment 1 assessed the role of motivation in producing timing deficits in the peak procedure and found that performance in D2OE mice was improved by increasing motivation. In addition, performance was impaired in control mice when motivation was decreased. In Experiment 2, we found that D2OE mice have no timing impairment when tested using the bisection task, a procedure in which the measure of timing performance is less influenced by motivation to respond. In Experiment 3, we also used the bisection task and found selective impairment in timing of long durations in D2OE mice. These results suggest that striatal D2 overexpression impairs timing by decreasing motivation and through its impact on working memory and/or sustained attention.},

  Abstract                 = {There has been a good deal of controversy over whether attention influences area V1-the first cortical area onto which information from the retina is projected. Attention to motion has been found to modulate monkey area MT and the human homolog of MT/MST. Here we show that activation of V1 by attention to motion is task dependent. Our stimulus consisted of a group of translating random dots superimposed over another group of random dots executing expansion motion. Subjects were instructed to pay attention selectively to the translation, expansion, or neither in particular (passive condition). The activity in the human MT/MST homolog measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was significantly higher in both the translation and the expansion conditions than in the passive condition, while the activity in area V1 was significantly higher only in the translation condition. These results show that attention to motion modulates area V1, and more interestingly that high-level cognitive processing such as attention may directly or indirectly determine the retroactive extent of feedback within the motion pathway in a manner dependent on the type of motion attended.},

  Abstract                 = {Driving is a complex multi-factorial task that taps underlying mechanisms of cognition and attention. Not surprisingly, therefore, many tests of cognition and attention are significantly associated with driving outcomes. In this article, we introduce driving researchers and clinicians with an interest in driving to the Attention Network Test (ANT), which to our knowledge has not previously been used in driving research. It is a recently developed test that is based on a neural network model of the human attention system. It combines elements of Posner's cuing paradigm [Posner, M.I., 1980. Orienting of attention. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 32, 3-25.] with the Eriksen & Eriksen flanker task [Eriksen, B.A., Eriksen, C.W., 1974. Effects of noise letters upon the identification of a target letter in a nonsearch task. Perception & Psychophysics 16, 143-149.], and provides measures of three distinct functions of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive function. Our results demonstrate that the ANT has very good concurrent validity with the Useful Field of View (UFOV), and that it is comparable to UFOV in its ability to predict road test scores for a simulated drive. These findings suggest that further investigation of the usefulness of the ANT as a tool for driving researchers and clinicians is merited.},

  Abstract                 = {Experiment 1 demonstrates that, while the outline shapes of bilaterally symmetrical dot patterns play a role in symmetry detection, the removal of the outline by a surrounding random-dot annulus merely reduces performance by a fixed amount. It does not affect the relative salience of different symmetry-axis orientations. The converse is also true: performance is almost as good when the symmetrical dot pattern is confined to the surrounding annulus but is disrupted similarly when the central area is filled with random dots (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, any one or more of three areas--a central circular area and two surrounding annuli--could be filled with vertically symmetrical or random dots and symmetry was detected reliably only when the central circular area contained the symmetrical dots. A new paradigm was explored in Experiment 4: subjects judged the orientation--left or right of vertical--of 20-dot symmetrical patterns oriented 1-4 deg left or right of vertical and with or without surrounding random-outline masks. Surprisingly, the orientation judgments were extremely precise, with JNDs of the order of 1 deg or less, and outline masking dots made no difference. Experiment 5 showed that performance was even better with just two dots and it made no difference whether these were separated by just under 4 deg or just over 20 deg. It was concluded that while pattern outline plays some role in dot symmetry detection, the major mechanisms are located near the fovea. It is suggested that the relative salience of vertical and horizontal symmetry only in central vision is related to the preponderance of foveal cells tuned to those orientations (Mansfield, Science 186, 1133-1135, 1974; Mansfield and Ronner, Brain Res. 149, 229-234, 1978) but that attentional factors and scanning strategies also boost the salience of oblique symmetry and the salience of vertical over horizontal symmetry (Wenderoth, Perception 23, 221-236, 1994).},

While a handful of conditions exist in which even salient visual stimuli can be rendered invisible, the mechanisms underlying such suppression remain poorly understood. Here, we describe experiments using a novel stimulation sequence that gives rise to the sudden and reliable subjective disappearance of a wide range of visual patterns. We found that a parafoveal target immediately vanished from perception following the abrupt onset of a surrounding texture. The probability of disappearance was influenced by the ocular configuration of the target and surround, as well as their spatial separation. In addition, suppression was critically dependent upon several hundred milliseconds of stimulus-specific adaptation. These findings demonstrate that the all-or-none disappearance of a salient visual target, which is reminiscent of a high-level selection process, is inextricably linked to topographic stimulus representations, presumably in the early visual cortex.},

Other studies have suggested that spatial attention causes a leftward shift in contrast response functions, such that its effects on responses to stimuli of different contrasts are not proportional. We have further explored the effects of attention on stimulus-response functions by measuring the responses of 131 individual V4 neurons in two monkeys while they did a task that controlled their spatial attention. Each neuron was tested with a set of stimuli that spanned complete ranges of orientation and contrast during different states of attention. Consistent with earlier reports, attention scaled responses to preferred and nonpreferred orientations proportionally. However, we did not find compelling evidence that the effects were best described by a leftward shift of the contrast response function. The modulation of neuronal responses by attention was well described by either a leftward shift or proportional scaling of the contrast response function. Consideration of differences in experimental design and analysis that may have contributed to this discrepancy suggests that it was premature to exclude a proportional scaling of responses to different contrasts by attention in favor of a leftward shift of contrast response functions. The current results reopen the possibility that the effects of attention on stimulus-response functions are well described by a single proportional increase in a neuron's response to all stimuli.},

  Abstract                 = {In two experiments, the effects of implicit attentional learning and habituation on inhibition of return (IOR) were assessed. Experiment 1 consisted of an informative variant of the spatial cuing paradigm (Posner, 1980), with the target appearing most often at the location next to the cue. Short-term as well as long-term learning of the regularities could be observed. This learning took place even though the participants were not able to verbalize the learned information, suggesting that the learning was implicit. By spatially separating the effects of implicit learning and IOR, we demonstrated that the magnitude of IOR slightly decreased because of long-term implicit orienting. In Experiment 2, a noninformative variant of the spatial cuing paradigm, IOR was still found to decrease over the course of the experiment. This suggests that habituation due to the mere repeated initiation of IOR also affects the magnitude of the IOR. This theory is supported by the finding that IOR recovered after short breaks in Experiment 2. However, habituation presumably only played a secondary role in Experiment 1. In sum, IOR was abolished by neither implicit attentional learning nor habituation. Here, the finding that IOR is not easily replaced by implicitly learned orienting clearly indicates that IOR is a powerful, low-level mechanism. We discuss implications of these results for the debate on the function of IOR.},

Set size was varied and reaction times (RT) were measured. For many unpracticed subjects, the slopes of the resulting RT X Set Size functions are too shallow to be consistent with Treisman's feature integration model, which proposes serial, self-terminating search for conjunctions. Searches for triple conjunctions (Color X Size X Form) are easier than searches for standard conjunctions and can be independent of set size. A guided search model similar to Hoffman's (1979) two-stage model can account for these data. In the model, parallel processes use information about simple features to guide attention in the search for conjunctions. Triple conjunctions are found more efficiently than standard conjunctions because three parallel processes can guide attention more effectively than two.},

  Abstract                 = {Visual cortical neurones display a variety of visual properties. Among those that emerge in the primary visual cortex V1 are sharpening of selectivity for spatial frequency and for orientation. The selectivity for these stimulus attributes can be measured around the peak of the tuning function, usually as bandwidth. Other selectivity measures take into account the response across a broader range of stimulus values. An example of such a global measure is the circular variance of orientation tuning. Here we introduce a similar measure in the spatial frequency domain that takes into account the shape of the tuning curve at frequencies lower than the peak, called the low-spatial frequency variance. Our recent studies with dynamic stimuli suggest that the selectivity for spatial frequency and orientation is strongly correlated with the degree of suppression at low spatial frequencies and off-axis orientations. Here we extend the study of the global tuning to stimulus conditions that measure the response of cells to the presentation of drifting sinusoidal grating stimuli for periods of a few seconds. We find that under such steady-state stimulus conditions there is a strong correlation between the global selectivity measures, orientation circular variance and low spatial frequency variance. Consistent with previous studies, there is a weaker correlation between the local tuning measures, orientation and spatial frequency bandwidth. These results support the idea that there are multiple factors that contribute to tuning and that suppression observed in dynamic experiments is also likely to contribute to the global selectivity for steady-state stimuli.},

  Abstract                 = {Consistent with human perceptual data, we found many more black-dominant than white-dominant responses in layer 2/3 neurons of the macaque primary visual cortex (V1). Seeking the mechanism of this black dominance of layer 2/3 neurons, we measured the laminar pattern of population responses (multiunit activity and local field potential) and found that a small preference for black is observable in early responses in layer 4C�0�2�0�5, the parvocellular-input layer, but not in the magnocellular-input layer 4C�0�2��. Surprisingly, further analysis of the dynamics of black-white responses in layers 4C�0�2�0�5 and 2/3 suggested that black-dominant responses in layer 2/3 were not generated simply because of the weak black-dominant inputs from 4C�0�2�0�5. Instead, our results indicated the neural circuitry in V1 is wired with a preference to strengthen black responses. We hypothesize that this selective wiring could be due to (1) feedforward connectivity from black-dominant neurons in layer 4C to cells in layer 2/3 or (2) recurrent interactions between black-dominant neurons in layer 2/3, or a combination of both.},

We mapped multi-unit activity and LFP visual responses with sparse-noise at several cortical sites simultaneously. The cortical magnification factor near the recording sites was precisely estimated by track reconstruction. The new method combined experimental measurements together with a model of signal summation to obtain the cortical spread of the LFP. This new method could be extended to cortical areas that have topographic maps such as S1 or A1, and to cortical areas without functional columnar maps, such as rodent visual cortex. In macaque V1, the LFP was the sum of signals from a very local region, the radius of which was on average 250 microm. The LFP's cortical spread varied across cortical layers, reaching a minimum value of 120 microm in layer 4B. An important functional consequence of the small cortical spread of the LFP is that the visual field maps of LFP and MUA recorded at a single electrode site were very similar. The similar spatial scale of the visual responses, the restricted cortical spread, and their laminar variation led to new insights about the sources and possible applications of the LFP.},

The speed of recalled spike sequences may reflect the internal dynamics of the network rather than the motion speed. In awake rats, such recall was observed during a synchronized ('quiet wakeful') brain state having large-amplitude, low-frequency local field potential (LFP) but not in a desynchronized ('active') state having low-amplitude, high-frequency LFP. Such conditioning-enhanced, cue-evoked sequential spiking of a V1 ensemble may contribute to experience-based perceptual inference in a brain state-dependent manner.},

We found progressive strengthening and accelerating in both facilitation of neurons encoding the contour elements and suppression of neurons responding to the background components. The enhancement of this figure-ground contrast in V1 was closely correlated with improved behavioral performance on a daily basis. Decoding accuracy of a simple linear classifier based on V1 population responses also paralleled the animal's behavioral changes.

In all experiments, one stimulus (either the target or one of the distractors) had an abrupt onset; the remaining letters did not. The effectiveness of the cue was manipulated (varying either its duration or its predictive validity) to test whether abrupt onsets capture attention even when subjects are in a highly focused attentional state. Results showed that onsets do not necessarily capture attention in violation of an observer's intentions. A mechanism for partially automatic attentional capture by abrupt onset is proposed, and the diagnosticity of the intentionality criterion for automaticity is discussed.},

Responses of ON and OFF retinal and thalamic neurons are approximately equal in magnitude (Kr�0�1�0�4ger and Fischer, 1975; Kremers et al., 1993), but psychophysical studies have shown that humans detect light decrements (black) better and faster than increments (white) (Blackwell, 1946; Short, 1966; Krauskopf, 1980; Whittle, 1986; Bowen et al., 1989; Chan and Tyler, 1992; Kontsevich and Tyler, 1999; Chubb and Nam, 2000; Dannemiller and Stephens, 2001). From recordings of single-cell activity in the macaque monkey's primary visual cortex (V1), we found that black-dominant neurons substantially outnumbered white-dominant neurons in the corticocortical output layers 2/3, but the numbers of black- and white-dominant neurons were nearly equal in the thalamocortical input layer 4c. These results strongly suggest that the black-over-white preference is generated or greatly amplified in V1. The predominance of OFF neurons in layers 2/3 of V1, which provide visual input to higher cortical areas, may explain why human subjects detect black more easily than white. Furthermore, our results agree with human EEG and fMRI findings that V1 responses to decrements are stronger than to increments, though the OFF/ON imbalance we found in layers 2/3 of macaque V1 is much larger than in the whole V1 population in the human V1 experiments (Zemon et al., 1988, 1995; Olman et al., 2008).},

  Abstract                 = {Previously we have shown that transient attention--the more automatic, stimulus-driven component of spatial attention--enhances spatial resolution. Specifically, transient attention improves texture segmentation at the periphery, where spatial resolution is too low, but impairs performance at central locations, where spatial resolution is already too high for the task. In the present study we investigated whether sustained attention--the more controlled component of spatial attention-can also affect texture segmentation, and if so whether its effect will be similar to that of transient attention. To that end we combined central, symbolic cues with texture displays in which the target appears at several eccentricities. We found that sustained attention can also affect texture segmentation, but unlike transient attention, sustained attention improved performance at all eccentricities. Comparing the effect of pre-cues and post-cues indicated that the benefit brought about by sustained attention is significantly greater than the effect of location uncertainty reduction. These findings indicate that sustained attention is a more flexible mechanism that can optimize performance at all eccentricities in a task where performance is constrained by spatial resolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Monkeys with unilateral lesions of the primary visual cortex (V1) can make saccades to visual stimuli in their contralateral ("affected") hemifield, but their sensitivity to luminance contrast is reduced. We examined whether the effects of V1 lesions were restricted to vision or included later stages of visual-oculomotor processing. Monkeys with unilateral V1 lesions were tested with a visually guided saccade task with stimuli in various spatial positions and of various luminance contrasts. Saccades to the stimuli in the affected hemifield were compared with those to the near-threshold stimuli in the normal hemifield so that the performances of localization were similar. Scatter in the end points of saccades to the affected hemifield was much larger than that of saccades to the near-threshold stimuli in the normal hemifield. Additional analysis revealed that this was because the initial directional error was not as sufficiently compensated as it was in the normal hemifield. The distribution of saccadic reaction times in the affected hemifield tended to be narrow. We modeled the distribution of saccadic reaction times by a modified diffusion model and obtained evidence that the decision threshold for initiation of saccades to the affected hemifield was lower than that for saccades to the normal hemifield. These results suggest that the geniculostriate pathway is crucial for on-line compensatory mechanisms of saccadic control and for decision processes. We propose that these results reflect deficits in deliberate control of visual-oculomotor processing after V1 lesions, which may parallel loss of visual awareness in human blindsight patients.},

  Abstract                 = {In the cortex, the interactions among neurons give rise to transient coherent activity patterns that underlie perception, cognition, and action. Recently, it was actively debated whether the most basic interactions, i.e., the pairwise correlations between neurons or groups of neurons, suffice to explain those observed activity patterns. So far, the evidence reported is controversial. Importantly, the overall organization of neuronal interactions and the mechanisms underlying their generation, especially those of high-order interactions, have remained elusive. Here we show that higher-order interactions are required to properly account for cortical dynamics such as ongoing neuronal avalanches in the alert monkey and evoked visual responses in the anesthetized cat. A Gaussian interaction model that utilizes the observed pairwise correlations and event rates and that applies intrinsic thresholding identifies those higher-order interactions correctly, both in cortical local field potentials and spiking activities. This allows for accurate prediction of large neuronal population activities as required, e.g., in brain-machine interface paradigms. Our results demonstrate that higher-order interactions are inherent properties of cortical dynamics and suggest a simple solution to overcome the apparent formidable complexity previously thought to be intrinsic to those interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Top-down modulation of sensory processing allows the animal to select inputs most relevant to current tasks. We found that the cingulate (Cg) region of the mouse frontal cortex powerfully influences sensory processing in the primary visual cortex (V1) through long-range projections that activate local �0�2�0�6-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) circuits. Optogenetic activation of Cg neurons enhanced V1 neuron responses and improved visual discrimination. Focal activation of Cg axons in V1 caused a response increase at the activation site but a decrease at nearby locations (center-surround modulation). Whereas somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons contributed preferentially to surround suppression, vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive interneurons were crucial for center facilitation. Long-range corticocortical projections thus act through local microcircuits to exert spatially specific top-down modulation of sensory processing.},

In this paper the authors investigated the long range feedback projection to V1 in mice and discovered that the center surround structure seen in top-down attention modulation and bottom-up stimulus contextual modulation can be explained by local circuit within V1. A interaction between SOM and VIP inhibitory neurons shaped the excitatory neuronal responses into center and surround structure when the feedback is focal but not wide spread.},

We obviated this possibility using stimuli that observers could not perceive, but that nevertheless, through orientation contrast between foreground and background regions, attracted attention to improve a localized visual discrimination. When orientation contrast increased, so did the degree of attraction, and two physiological measures: the amplitude of the earliest (C1) component of the ERP, which is associated with primary visual cortex, and fMRI BOLD signals in areas V1-V4 (but not the intraparietal sulcus). Significantly, across observers, the degree of attraction correlated with the C1 amplitude and just the V1 BOLD signal. These findings strongly support the proposal that a bottom-up saliency map is created in V1, challenging the dominant view that the saliency map is generated in the parietal cortex.},

  Abstract                 = {Human observers are typically unaware of the eye of origin of visual inputs. This study shows that an eye of origin or ocular singleton, e.g., an item in the left eye among background items in the right eye, can nevertheless attract attention automatically. Observers searched for a uniquely oriented bar, i.e., an orientation singleton, in a background of horizontal bars. Their reports of the tilt direction of the search target in a brief (200 ms) display were more accurate in a dichoptic congruent (DC) condition, when the target was also an ocular singleton, than in a monocular (M) condition, when all bars were presented to the same single eye, or a dichoptic incongruent (DI) condition, when an ocular singleton was a background bar. The better performance in DC did not depend on the ability of the observers to report the presence of an ocular singleton by making forced choices in the same stimuli (though without the orientation singleton). This suggests that the ocular singleton exogenously cued attention to its location, facilitating the identification of the tilt singleton in the DC condition. When the search display persisted without being masked, observers' reaction times (RTs) for reporting the location of the search target were shorter in the DC, and longer in the DI, than the M condition, regardless of whether the observers were aware that different conditions existed. In an analogous design, similar RT patterns were observed for the task of finding an orientation contrast texture border. These results suggest that in typical trials, attention was more quickly attracted to or initially distracted from the target in the DC or DI condition, respectively. Hence, an ocular singleton, though elusive to awareness, can effectively compete for attention with an orientation singleton (tilted 20 or 50 degrees from background bars in the current study). Similarly, it can also make a difficult visual search easier by diminishing the set size effect. Since monocular neurons with the eye of origin information are abundant in the primary visual cortex (V1) and scarce in other cortical areas, and since visual awareness is believed to be absent or weaker in V1 than in other cortical areas, our results provide a hallmark of the role of V1 in creating a bottom-up saliency map to guide attentional selection.},

We show that effects of the salience of image items can remain for up to more than a second longer, influencing both eye movements and explicit choice. In our experiment, subjects searched for a moderately salient target among 659 non-targets to report whether the target was in the left or right half of the display, guessing if necessary, while their gaze was tracked. In some trials, the search display was replaced by a mask before their gaze reached the target. We call such trials 'after-search' trials, and the behavior after the mask onset is after-searching. In after-search, subjects made 3.1 +/- 2.8 saccades on the mask before reporting. In some after-search trials called 'gaze-arrival' trials, they looked at the location of the vanished target after up to several on-mask saccades; in these trials, the subjects' reports were more accurate. This saliency effect begs the question of what memory, saccade generation, or other neural mechanisms might be responsible.},

  Abstract                 = {A border between two image regions normally belongs to only one of the regions; determining which one it belongs to is essential for surface perception and figure-ground segmentation. Border ownership is signaled by a class of V2 neurons, even though its value depends on information coming from well outside their classical receptive fields. I use a model of V2 to show that this visual area is able to generate the ownership signal by itself, without requiring any top-down mechanism or external explicit labels for figures, T junctions, or corners. In the model, neurons have spatially local classical receptive fields, are tuned to orientation, and receive information (from V1) about the location and orientation of borders. Border ownership signals that model physiological observations arise through finite range, intraareal interactions. Additional effects from surface features and attention are discussed. The model licenses testable predictions.},

The main neuronal evidence of BOWN was from Zhou et al., 2000; von der Heydt et al., 2000; von der Heydt et al., 2003; F.T. Qiu et al., 2001. There is also insightful psychophysical observations (Nakayama et al., 1995)

This paper is the first to proposed a "mimial" v2 model to generate the BOWN properties of the previous studies and made some preditions on the size and luminence influence of the BOWN reponses in V2.

For now, I have only read the introduction and the discussion part. I have not read the main model part yet.},

  Abstract                 = {Drawing portraits upside down is a trick that allows novice artists to reproduce lower-level image features, e.g., contours, while reducing interference from higher-level face cognition. Limiting the available processing time to suffice for lower- but not higher-level operations is a more general way of reducing interference. We elucidate this interference in a novel visual-search task to find a target among distractors. The target had a unique lower-level orientation feature but was identical to distractors in its higher-level object shape. Through bottom-up processes, the unique feature attracted gaze to the target. Subsequently, recognizing the attended object as identically shaped as the distractors, viewpoint invariant object recognition interfered. Consequently, gaze often abandoned the target to search elsewhere. If the search stimulus was extinguished at time T after the gaze arrived at the target, reports of target location were more accurate for shorter (T<500 ms) presentations. This object-to-feature interference, though perhaps unexpected, could underlie common phenomena such as the visual-search asymmetry that finding a familiar letter N among its mirror images is more difficult than the converse. Our results should enable additional examination of known phenomena and interactions between different levels of visual processes.},

  Abstract                 = {A unique vertical bar among horizontal bars is salient and pops out perceptually. Physiological data have suggested that mechanisms in the primary visual cortex (V1) contribute to the high saliency of such a unique basic feature, but indicated little regarding whether V1 plays an essential or peripheral role in input-driven or bottom-up saliency. Meanwhile, a biologically based V1 model has suggested that V1 mechanisms can also explain bottom-up saliencies beyond the pop-out of basic features, such as the low saliency of a unique conjunction feature such as a red vertical bar among red horizontal and green vertical bars, under the hypothesis that the bottom-up saliency at any location is signaled by the activity of the most active cell responding to it regardless of the cell's preferred features such as color and orientation. The model can account for phenomena such as the difficulties in conjunction feature search, asymmetries in visual search, and how background irregularities affect ease of search. In this paper, we report nontrivial predictions from the V1 saliency hypothesis, and their psychophysical tests and confirmations. The prediction that most clearly distinguishes the V1 saliency hypothesis from other models is that task-irrelevant features could interfere in visual search or segmentation tasks which rely significantly on bottom-up saliency. For instance, irrelevant colors can interfere in an orientation-based task, and the presence of horizontal and vertical bars can impair performance in a task based on oblique bars. Furthermore, properties of the intracortical interactions and neural selectivities in V1 predict specific emergent phenomena associated with visual grouping. Our findings support the idea that a bottom-up saliency map can be at a lower visual area than traditionally expected, with implications for top-down selection mechanisms.},

To understand the mechanisms of attentive stimulus processing in this pulvinar-cortex loop, we investigated the interactions between the pulvinar, area V4, and IT cortex in a spatial-attention task. Sensory processing and the influence of attention in the pulvinar appeared to reflect its cortical inputs. However, pulvinar deactivation led to a reduction of attentional effects on firing rates and gamma synchrony in V4, a reduction of sensory-evoked responses and overall gamma coherence within V4, and severe behavioral deficits in the affected portion of the visual field. Conversely, pulvinar deactivation caused an increase in low-frequency cortical oscillations, often associated with inattention or sleep. Thus, cortical interactions with the ventro-lateral pulvinar are necessary for normal attention and sensory processing and for maintaining the cortex in an active state.},

  Abstract                 = {As information propagates along the ventral visual hierarchy, neuronal responses become both more specific for particular image features and more tolerant of image transformations that preserve those features. Here, we present evidence that neurons in area V2 are selective for local statistics that occur in natural visual textures, and tolerant of manipulations that preserve these statistics. Texture stimuli were generated by sampling from a statistical model, with parameters chosen to match the parameters of a set of visually distinct natural texture images. Stimuli generated with the same statistics are perceptually similar to each other despite differences, arising from the sampling process, in the precise spatial location of features. We assessed the accuracy with which these textures could be classified based on the responses of V1 and V2 neurons recorded individually in anesthetized macaque monkeys. We also assessed the accuracy with which particular samples could be identified, relative to other statistically matched samples. For populations of up to 100 cells, V1 neurons supported better performance in the sample identification task, whereas V2 neurons exhibited better performance in texture classification. Relative to V1, the responses of V2 show greater selectivity and tolerance for the representation of texture statistics.},

Contextual modulation was studied using texture displays in which texture covering the receptive field (RF) was the same in all trials, but the perceptual context of this texture could vary depending on the configuration of extra-RF texture elements. We found robust contextual modulation when disparity, color, luminance, and orientation cues variously defined a textured figure centered on the RF of V1 neurons. We found contextual modulation to have a spatial extent of approximately 8 to 10 degrees diameter parafoveally. Contextual modulation correlated with perceptual experience of both binocularly rivalrous texture displays and of displays with a simple example of surface occlusion. We found contextual modulation in V1 to have a characteristic latency of 80-100 msec after stimulus onset, potentially allowing feedback from extrastriate areas to underlie to this effect.},

The authors used a large array of different cues and different timings to test whether the modulatory effect seen in V1 by the figure-ground stimulus is perception relevent. The authors argued that ~100ms delay of the FGM allows the visual information arrive at all corticial hirarchies and the processed perceptual relevent information may be send back to V1. But the authors didn't explain what is the function of such feedbacks. Further investigations is needed to demonstrate the relationship between the V1 FGM and concious awareness.},
