  abstract = {Evoked activity in the mammalian cortex and the resulting behavioral
	responses exhibit a large variability to repeated presentations of
	the same stimulus. This study examined whether the variability can
	be attributed to ongoing activity. Ongoing and evoked spatiotemporal
	activity patterns in the cat visual cortex were measured with real-time
	optical imaging; local field potentials and discharges of single
	neurons were recorded simultaneously, by electrophysiological techniques.
	The evoked activity appeared deterministic, and the variability resulted
	from the dynamics of ongoing activity, presumably reflecting the
	instantaneous state of cortical networks. In spite of the large variability,
	evoked responses in single trials could be predicted by linear summation
	of the deterministic response and the preceding ongoing activity.
	Ongoing activity must play an important role in cortical function
	and cannot be ignored in exploration of cognitive processes.},

	on action potential rate--an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical

	The energy expended on signaling is a large fraction of the total
	energy used by the brain; this favors the use of energy efficient

	the use of distributed codes, with <or=15\% of neurons simultaneously

	power from a fixed number of neurons. Functional magnetic resonance

  abstract = {Natural scenes contain a rich variety of contours that the visual
	system extracts to segregate the retinal image into perceptually
	coherent regions. Covert spatial attention helps extract contours
	by enhancing contrast sensitivity for 1st-order, luminance-defined
	patterns at attended locations, while reducing sensitivity at unattended
	locations, relative to neutral attention allocation. However, humans
	are also sensitive to 2nd-order patterns such as spatial variations
	of texture, which are predominant in natural scenes and cannot be
	detected by linear mechanisms. We assess whether and how exogenous
	attention--the involuntary and transient capture of spatial attention--affects
	the contrast sensitivity of channels sensitive to 2nd-order, texture-defined
	patterns. Using 2nd-order, texture-defined stimuli, we demonstrate
	that exogenous attention increases 2nd-order contrast sensitivity
	at the attended location, while decreasing it at unattended locations,
	relative to a neutral condition. By manipulating both 1st- and 2nd-order
	spatial frequency, we find that the effects of attention depend both
	on 2nd-order spatial frequency of the stimulus and the observer's
	2nd-order spatial resolution at the target location. At parafoveal
	locations, attention enhances 2nd-order contrast sensitivity to high,
	but not to low 2nd-order spatial frequencies; at peripheral locations
	attention also enhances sensitivity to low 2nd-order spatial frequencies.
	Control experiments rule out the possibility that these effects might
	be due to an increase in contrast sensitivity at the 1st-order stage
	of visual processing. Thus, exogenous attention affects 2nd-order
	contrast sensitivity at both attended and unattended locations.},

	The cue-target aspect of traditional paradigms for attention studies
	is equivalent to 'warning S1'-'imperative S2' in slow potential designs.
	We simplified Posner's spatial cueing task [Posner, M.I. 1980. Orienting
	of attention.Q. J. Exp. Psychol. Feb;32 (1), 3-25; Posner, M.I.,

	only, by using visual cues to indicate the mere presence, on a known
	central position, of the eventual target (17 ms duration, +/-0.3
	degrees grey circle). We recorded slow potentials on 12 healthy subjects,
	by 124-channel EEG system (Neuroscan Inc.), and modeled their generators
	using current density reconstruction (CDR) by L(p) 1.2 norm minimization
	("Curry V4.6", Neurosoft Inc.) applied to the target onset time.
	MRIs were obtained for each subject for constraining source models
	to individual brain anatomy. Average slow potentials were computed
	from above 60 artifact-free EEG-epochs (ISI=1.6 s, average ITI=2.5
	s). We tabulated individual cortical current distributions by cytoarchitectonic
	area of Brodmann, after scaling into negligible, low, moderate and
	strong local density, based on percentile bands with respect to absolute
	maximum current. Despite the task's simplicity, the main result was
	individual variability and complexity in both scalp voltage and cortical
	current distributions. As observed in our previous studies, there
	was strong intersubject variability in the exact distribution of
	task-related cortical activity. Only parietal area 7 bilaterally
	was non-negligibly active in all subjects (currents above 10\% maximum).
	As opposed to drawing conclusions based on group averaged data, we
	propose that activity by cytoarchitectonic area be ranked and statistically
	analysed only after being scaled on each individual. Based on the
	present results, the concept of a universal attention-related set
	of cortical areas if restricted to common areas across subjects is
	challenged, since even area 7 may no longer be common when the sample
	size becomes larger. We discuss the fact that group averaging may
	de-emphasize weakly but consistently active areas, and emphasize
	strongly but inconsistently active ones.},

  abstract = {1. A task was used by Posner (1980) to measure shifts of attention
	that occurred covertly, in the absence of an eye movement or other
	orienting response. This paradigm was used here to assess the nature
	of covert attentional orienting in monkeys to develop an animal model
	for neurophysiological studies. Shifts of attention were measurable
	in monkeys and were consistent across a variety of experimental conditions.
	2. The paradigm required that monkeys fixate and release a bar at
	the appearance of a target, which was preceded by a cue. Reaction
	times to targets that followed peripheral cues at the same location
	(validly cued) were significantly faster than those that followed
	cues in the opposite visual field (invalidly cued). This difference
	was defined as the validity effect, which as in humans, is used as
	the measure of a covert attentional shift. 3. When the proportion
	of validly to invalidly cued targets was decreased, no change was
	seen in the validity effect of the monkeys. This is in contrast to
	humans, for whom the ratio of validly to invalidly cued targets affected
	the magnitude of the validity effect. When 80\% of the targets were
	preceded by cues at the same location, the validity effect was greatest.
	The effect was reversed when the proportions were reversed. From
	this result, it is concluded that cognitive processes can affect
	covert orienting to peripheral cues in humans, whereas in trained
	monkeys, performance was automatic. 4. To test whether cognitive
	influences on attention could be demonstrated in the monkey, an animal
	was taught to use symbolic, foveal signals to covertly direct attention.
	The magnitude of this validity effect was greater than that obtained
	with peripheral cues. 5. The effects of motivational and perceptual
	processes were tested. Although overall reaction times could be modified,
	the facilitating effects of the cues persisted. This constancy across
	motivational and perceptual levels supports the notion that the monkeys
	were performing the task in an automatic way, under the exogenous
	control of peripheral cues. 6. Most visual cuing has been tested
	with visual landmarks at the locations of cues and targets. These
	monkeys were trained with such landmarks, and when tested without
	them, the attentional effect of the cues was nearly abolished. These
	data suggest that local visual features can be important for covert
	orienting. 7. To determine the spatial extent of the effect of the
	cue, monkeys and humans were tested with four cue-target distances
	(0-60 degrees).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Dynamically shifting attention between behaviorally relevant stimuli
	in the environment is a key condition for successful adaptive behavior.
	Here, we investigated how exogenous (reflexive) and endogenous (voluntary)
	shifts of visual spatial attention interact to modulate activity
	of single neurons in extrastriate area MT. We used a double-cueing
	paradigm, in which the first cue instructed two macaque monkeys to
	covertly attend to one of three moving random dot patterns until
	a second cue, whose unpredictable onset exogenously captured attention,
	either signaled to shift or maintain the current focus of attention.
	The neuronal activity revealed correlates of both exogenous and endogenous
	attention, which could be well distinguished by their characteristic
	temporal dynamics. The earliest effect was a transient interruption
	of the focus of endogenous attention by the onset of the second cue.
	The neuronal signature of this exogenous capture of attention was
	a short-latency decrease of responses to the stimulus attended so
	far. About 70 ms later, the influence of exogenous attention leveled
	off, which was reflected in two concurrent processes: responses to
	the newly cued stimulus continuously increased because of allocation
	of endogenous attention, while, surprisingly, there was also a gradual
	rebound of attentional enhancement of the previously relevant stimulus.
	Only after an additional 110 ms did endogenous disengagement of attention
	from this previously relevant stimulus become evident. These patterns
	of attentional modulation can be most parsimoniously explained by
	assuming two distinct attentional mechanisms drawing on the same
	capacity-limited system, with exogenous attention having a much faster
	time course than endogenous attention.},

  abstract = {The abundant concentration of cytochrome oxidase in patches or blobs
	of primate striate cortex has never been explained. Patches are thought
	to contain unoriented, color-opponent neurons. Lacking orientation
	selectivity, these cells might endow patches with high metabolic
	activity because they respond to all contours in visual scenes. To
	test this idea, we measured orientation tuning in layer 2/3 of macaque
	cortical area V1 using acutely implanted 100-electrode arrays. Each
	electrode recording site was identified and assigned to the patch
	or interpatch compartment. The mean orientation bandwidth of cells
	was 28.4° in patches and 25.8° in interpatches. Neurons in patches
	were indeed less orientation selective, but the difference was subtle,
	indicating that the processing of form and color is not strictly
	segregated in V1. The most conspicuous finding was that patch cells
	had a 49\% greater overall firing rate. This global difference in
	neuronal responsiveness, rather than an absence of orientation tuning,
	may account for the rich mitochondrial enzyme activity that defines
	patches.},

	We addressed this question by showing that the relevance of an abruptly
	appearing visual object (cue) changes how observers orient attention
	toward a subsequent object (target) and how this target is represented
	in the activity of neurons in the superior colliculus. Initially
	after the appearance of the cue, attention is driven to its locus.
	This capture of attention is followed by a second bias in orienting
	attention, where observers preferentially orient to new locations
	in the visual scene-an effect called inhibition of return. In the
	superior colliculus, these two automatic biases in orienting attention
	were associated with changes in neural activity linked to the appearance
	of the target-relatively stronger activity linked to the capture
	of attention and weaker activity linked to inhibition of return.
	This behavioral pattern changes when the cue predicts the upcoming
	location of the target-the benefit associated with the capture of
	attention is enhanced and inhibition of return is reduced. These
	goal-driven changes in behavior were associated with an increase
	in pretarget- and target-related activity. Taken together, the goals
	of observers modify stimulus-driven changes in neural activity with
	both signals represented in the salience maps of the superior colliculi.},

	serial reaction time test. This test measures sustained visual attention,
	a behavior that is known to require the prefrontal cortex. Rats were
	trained to respond to a brief light stimulus presented randomly in
	one of five spatial locations, with 100 trials per session. Once
	performance had stabilized rats were treated with escalating doses
	of amphetamine (three injections per week for 5 weeks at 1-5 mg/kg

	weeks of withdrawal. During the amphetamine-treatment and withdrawal
	phases accuracy of responding was unaffected, but errors of omission
	increased. Lengthening the stimulus duration abolished this effect.
	Reducing the stimulus duration also reduced response accuracy and
	this effect was more marked in amphetamine-treated rats. Both reduced
	accuracy, and increased omissions, seen in amphetamine-treated rats
	were reversed by injecting the D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 into
	the medial prefrontal cortex. This treatment also prevented the decline
	in accuracy in control animals that resulted from reducing the stimulus
	duration. These results, indicating that exposure to amphetamine
	induces a long-lasting deficit in visual attention, add to a growing
	list of deficits suggesting that amphetamine-sensitized state may
	model the cognitive deficit state in schizophrenia. The reversal
	of these deficits by a D1 receptor agonist provides further evidence
	that prefrontal D1 dopamine receptors are involved in cognition,
	and may be a potential target for treatment of impaired cognition

	employed a spatial resolution task which required the accurate discrimination
	of the orientation of a Landolt "C" ring. The C appeared as single
	target in specific retinal locations while subjects maintained fixation
	of a central fixation point. The minimal discernable size of the
	"C" (=acuity threshold) was determined as a function of cue condition,
	retinal eccentricity (3 degrees -15 degrees ), and stimulus onset
	asynchrony (SOA) (200-1100 ms). For both species, we found consistent
	benefits from spatial cueing with differences in absolute thresholds
	ranging from 6\% to 25\%. These differences increased with retinal
	eccentricity and decreased with longer SOAs. Further experiments
	performed with humans only, showed that the effect of spatial cueing
	on visual discrimination is independent of spatial uncertainty, i.e.
	the number of possible target locations (2 versus 4), but fades with
	longer target presentation times. From our results we draw the following
	conclusions. (i) Since sensory noise and spatial uncertainty was
	small in our tasks, spatial shifts of attention involve signal enhancement
	in both, human and non-human primates. (ii) The similarity of the
	results obtained for humans and macaque monkeys indicates that the
	latter may serve as a suitable model system in studies trying to
	tackle the neural underpinnings of attentional control. (iii) In

  abstract = {Nearby cortical neurons often have correlated trial-to-trial response
	variability, and a significant fraction of their spikes occur synchronously.
	These two forms of correlation are both believed to arise from common
	synaptic input, but the origin of this input is unclear. We investigated
	the source of correlated responsivity by recording from pairs of
	single neurons in primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaque monkeys
	and comparing correlated variability and synchrony for spontaneous
	activity and activity evoked by stimuli of different orientations
	and contrasts. These two stimulus manipulations would be expected
	to have different effects on the cortical pool providing input to
	the recorded pair: changing stimulus orientation should recruit different
	populations of cells, whereas changing stimulus contrast affects
	primarily the relative strength of sensory drive and ongoing cortical
	activity. Consistent with this predicted difference, we found that
	correlation was affected by these stimulus manipulations in different
	ways. Synchrony was significantly stronger for orientations that
	drove both neurons well than for those that did not, but correlation
	on longer time scales was orientation independent. Reducing stimulus
	contrast resulted in a decrease in the temporal precision of synchronous
	firing and an enhancement of correlated response variability on longer
	time scales. Our results thus suggest that correlated responsivity
	arises from mechanisms operating at two distinct timescales: one
	that is orientation tuned and that determines the strength of temporally
	precise synchrony, and a second that is contrast sensitive, of low
	temporal frequency, and present in ongoing cortical activity.},

  abstract = {Detection of a visual signal requires information to reach a system
	capable of eliciting arbitrary responses required by the experimenter.
	Detection latencies are reduced when subjects receive a cue that
	indicates where in the visual field the signal will occur. This shift
	in efficiency appears to be due to an alignment (orienting) of the
	central attentional system with the pathways to be activated by the
	visual input. It would also be possible to describe these results
	as being due to a reduced criterion at the expected target position.
	However, this description ignores important constraints about the
	way in which expectancy improves performance. First, when subjects
	are cued on each trial, they show stronger expectancy effects than
	when a probable position is held constant for a block, indicating
	the active nature of the expectancy. Second, while information on
	spatial position improves performance, information on the form of
	the stimulus does not. Third, expectancy may lead to improvements
	in latency without a reduction in accuracy. Fourth, there appears
	to be little ability to lower the criterion at two positions that
	are not spatially contiguous. A framework involving the employment
	of a limited-capacity attentional mechanism seems to capture these
	constraints better than the more general language of criterion setting.
	Using this framework, we find that attention shifts are not closely
	related to the saccadic eye movement system. For luminance detection
	the retina appears to be equipotential with respect to attention
	shifts, since costs to unexpected stimuli are similar whether foveal
	or peripheral. These results appear to provide an important model
	system for the study of the relationship between attention and the
	structure of the visual system.},

  abstract = {1. To understand some of the contributions of parietal cortex to the
	dynamics of visual spatial attention, we recorded from cortical cells
	of monkeys performing attentional tasks. We studied 484 neurons in
	the intraparietal sulcus and adjacent gyral tissue of two monkeys.
	We measured phasic responses to peripheral visual stimuli while the
	monkeys attended toward or away from the stimuli or when attention
	was not controlled. Neurons were tested while the monkeys gazed at
	a spot of light (simple fixation task), actively attended to a foveal
	target (foveal attention task), performed a reaction time task (cued
	reaction time task), made saccadic eye movements to visual targets
	(saccade task), or responded to a repetitious peripheral target (probability
	task). 2. In a previous paper we demonstrated that monkeys, like
	humans, responded more quickly to visual targets when the targets
	followed briefly flashed visual cues (validly cued targets) (Bowman
	et al. 1993). It has been hypothesized that the cue attracts attention
	to its locus and results in faster reaction times (Posner 1980).
	In the present physiological studies, visual cues consistently excited
	these neurons when they were flashed in the receptive field. Such
	activity might signal a shift of attention. Visual targets that fell
	within the receptive field and that immediately followed the cue
	evoked relatively weak responses. This response was due to a relative
	refractory period. 3. Next we tested attentional processes in these
	tasks that were independent of the visual response to the cue. We
	placed the cue outside of the receptive field and the target within
	the receptive field. We found that 23\% of these cells had a significant
	decrease in their firing rate to validly cued targets in their receptive
	fields under these conditions. Strong responses were evoked by the
	same target when the cue was flashed in the opposite hemifield (invalidly
	cued targets). Thus this group of neurons responded best when attention
	was directed toward the opposite hemifield. 4. For another group
	of parietal cells (13\%) there was an enhanced response to targets
	in the visual receptive field when the cue was in the same hemifield.
	For the remaining 64\% of the cells there was no significant modulation
	in this task. 5. The cued reaction time task involved exogenous control
	of attention; the sensory cue gave spatial and temporal direction
	to attention. We used several other tasks to test for endogenous
	control of attention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	in the superior colliculus and their relation to visual spatial attention.
	We used a cued reaction time task studied in detail previously (Bowman
	et al. 1993; Posner 1980). Monkeys learned to fixate a spot of light
	and release a bar when a target light appeared. Cues on the same
	side as the target (valid cue) were associated with faster reaction
	times than those on the opposite side (invalid cue). The difference
	in reaction times is hypothesized to be a measure of attention. 2.
	A total of 79 neurons within the superficial layers of the superior
	colliculi of two monkeys were studied. When the cues and targets
	were positioned so that both were within the visual receptive field,
	the cues excited the cells, and this produced a refractoriness to
	the targets for the following 400 ms. Both the ON and OFF responses
	to the cue were constant under all conditions. 3. These neurons were
	also tested with the cue just outside of the visual receptive field.
	This was done to avoid refractory effects from the cue; there was
	no significant modulation of the response to the target under these
	conditions. The visual responses of neurons in the intermediate layers
	of the superior colliculus also responded equivalently under these
	conditions. 4. When the activity of cells within the foveal representation
	was compared during the performance of three tasks, there was differential
	activity. The appearance of the fixation point during the performance
	of the cued reaction time task led to a strong, transient discharge.(ABSTRACT

	which cognitive functions are engaged in normal CPT performance.
	The aims of the present study were to identify the neurocognitive
	functions engaged in the main variants of the CPT and to determine
	to what extent these variants differentially engage these functions.
	We hypothesized that the main CPT versions (CPT-X, CPT-AX, CPT-Identical
	Pairs) can be distinguished by whether they demand sustained or transient
	attention and sustained or transient response preparation. Transient
	attention to objects like letters or digits, that is, the need to
	switch attention to different objects from trial to trial, impairs
	target detection accuracy relative to sustained attention to a single
	object. Transient response preparation, that is, the possibility
	to switch response preparation on and off from trial to trial, improves
	response speed relative to having to sustain response preparation
	across all trials. Comparison of task performance and Event-Related
	brain Potentials (ERPs) of healthy participants obtained in the main
	CPT variants confirmed these hypotheses. Behavioral and ERP measures
	indicated worse target detection in the CPT-AX than in the CPT-X,
	consistent with a higher demand on transient attention in that task.
	In contrast, behavioral and ERP measures indicated higher response
	speed in the CPT-AX than in the CPT-X, associated with more response
	preparation in advance of the targets. This supports the idea of
	increased transient response preparation in the CPT-AX. We conclude
	that CPTs differ along at least two task variables that each influences
	a different cognitive function.},

	trial-to-trial fluctuations in response strength are shared between
	neurons, and spikes often occur synchronously. Understanding the
	properties and mechanisms that generate these forms of correlation
	is critical for determining their role in cortical processing. We
	therefore investigated the spatial extent and functional specificity
	of correlated spontaneous and evoked activity. Because feedforward,
	recurrent, and feedback pathways have distinct extents and specificity,
	we reasoned that these measurements could elucidate the contribution
	of each type of input. We recorded single unit activity with microelectrode
	arrays which allowed us to measure correlation in many hundreds of
	pairings, across a large range of spatial scales. Our data show that
	correlated evoked activity is generated by two mechanisms that link
	neurons with similar orientation preferences on different spatial
	scales: one with high temporal precision and a limited spatial extent
	(approximately 3 mm), and a second that gives rise to correlation
	on a slow time scale and extends as far as we were able to measure
	(10 mm). The former is consistent with common input provided by horizontal
	connections; the latter likely involves feedback from extrastriate
	cortex. Spontaneous activity was correlated over a similar spatial
	extent, but approximately twice as strongly as evoked activity. Visual
	stimuli thus caused a substantial decrease in correlation, particularly
	at response onset. These properties and the circuit mechanism they

  abstract = {Driving is a complex multi-factorial task that taps underlying mechanisms
	of cognition and attention. Not surprisingly, therefore, many tests
	of cognition and attention are significantly associated with driving
	outcomes. In this article, we introduce driving researchers and clinicians
	with an interest in driving to the Attention Network Test (ANT),
	which to our knowledge has not previously been used in driving research.
	It is a recently developed test that is based on a neural network
	model of the human attention system. It combines elements of Posner's
	cuing paradigm [Posner, M.I., 1980. Orienting of attention. Quarterly
	Journal of Experimental Psychology 32, 3-25.] with the Eriksen &
	Eriksen flanker task [Eriksen, B.A., Eriksen, C.W., 1974. Effects
	of noise letters upon the identification of a target letter in a
	nonsearch task. Perception & Psychophysics 16, 143-149.], and provides
	measures of three distinct functions of attention: alerting, orienting,
	and executive function. Our results demonstrate that the ANT has
	very good concurrent validity with the Useful Field of View (UFOV),
	and that it is comparable to UFOV in its ability to predict road
	test scores for a simulated drive. These findings suggest that further
	investigation of the usefulness of the ANT as a tool for driving
	researchers and clinicians is merited.},

  abstract = {In two experiments, the effects of implicit attentional learning and
	habituation on inhibition of return (IOR) were assessed. Experiment
	1 consisted of an informative variant of the spatial cuing paradigm
	(Posner, 1980), with the target appearing most often at the location
	next to the cue. Short-term as well as long-term learning of the
	regularities could be observed. This learning took place even though
	the participants were not able to verbalize the learned information,
	suggesting that the learning was implicit. By spatially separating
	the effects of implicit learning and IOR, we demonstrated that the
	magnitude of IOR slightly decreased because of long-term implicit
	orienting. In Experiment 2, a noninformative variant of the spatial
	cuing paradigm, IOR was still found to decrease over the course of
	the experiment. This suggests that habituation due to the mere repeated
	initiation of IOR also affects the magnitude of the IOR. This theory
	is supported by the finding that IOR recovered after short breaks
	in Experiment 2. However, habituation presumably only played a secondary
	role in Experiment 1. In sum, IOR was abolished by neither implicit
	attentional learning nor habituation. Here, the finding that IOR
	is not easily replaced by implicitly learned orienting clearly indicates
	that IOR is a powerful, low-level mechanism. We discuss implications
	of these results for the debate on the function of IOR.},

  abstract = {Previously we have shown that transient attention--the more automatic,
	stimulus-driven component of spatial attention--enhances spatial
	resolution. Specifically, transient attention improves texture segmentation
	at the periphery, where spatial resolution is too low, but impairs
	performance at central locations, where spatial resolution is already
	too high for the task. In the present study we investigated whether
	sustained attention--the more controlled component of spatial attention-can
	also affect texture segmentation, and if so whether its effect will
	be similar to that of transient attention. To that end we combined
	central, symbolic cues with texture displays in which the target
	appears at several eccentricities. We found that sustained attention
	can also affect texture segmentation, but unlike transient attention,
	sustained attention improved performance at all eccentricities. Comparing
	the effect of pre-cues and post-cues indicated that the benefit brought
	about by sustained attention is significantly greater than the effect
	of location uncertainty reduction. These findings indicate that sustained
	attention is a more flexible mechanism that can optimize performance
	at all eccentricities in a task where performance is constrained
	by spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {In the cortex, the interactions among neurons give rise to transient
	coherent activity patterns that underlie perception, cognition, and
	action. Recently, it was actively debated whether the most basic
	interactions, i.e., the pairwise correlations between neurons or
	groups of neurons, suffice to explain those observed activity patterns.
	So far, the evidence reported is controversial. Importantly, the
	overall organization of neuronal interactions and the mechanisms
	underlying their generation, especially those of high-order interactions,
	have remained elusive. Here we show that higher-order interactions
	are required to properly account for cortical dynamics such as ongoing
	neuronal avalanches in the alert monkey and evoked visual responses
	in the anesthetized cat. A Gaussian interaction model that utilizes
	the observed pairwise correlations and event rates and that applies
	intrinsic thresholding identifies those higher-order interactions
	correctly, both in cortical local field potentials and spiking activities.
	This allows for accurate prediction of large neuronal population
	activities as required, e.g., in brain-machine interface paradigms.
	Our results demonstrate that higher-order interactions are inherent
	properties of cortical dynamics and suggest a simple solution to
	overcome the apparent formidable complexity previously thought to
	be intrinsic to those interactions.},
